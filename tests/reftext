5694-64029-0000 we remained several months but soon we were on the tramp again
5694-64029-0001 the federal army was concentrating at nashville there was no rest for the weary
5694-64029-0002 our army stopped at murfreesboro
5694-64029-0003 from time to time different regiments were sent forward to do picket duty
5694-64029-0004 the yankee picket lines were not a half mile off
5694-64029-0005 i am a videt you know the responsibility resting on me
5694-64029-0006 says he i would not trust a secesh on his word oath or bond march i say
5694-64029-0007 i soon found out that he had caught sight of the relief on the road and was afraid to shoot i quickly made up my mind
5694-64029-0008 my gun was at my feet and one step would get it
5694-64029-0009 i made a quick glance over my shoulder and grabbed at my gun
5694-64029-0010 he divined my motive and fired the ball missed its aim
5694-64029-0011 i think we must have killed a good many in the old field because we were firing all the time at the solid line as they advanced upon us
5694-64029-0012 we kept falling back and firing all day and were relieved by another regiment about dark we rejoined our regiment
5694-64029-0013 line of battle was formed on the north bank of stone's river on the yankee side
5694-64029-0014 bad generalship i thought it was christmas
5694-64029-0015 the private could but he was no general you see
5694-64029-0016 i called lieutenant colonel frierson's attention to the yankees and he remarked well i don't know whether they are yankees or not but if they are they will come out of there mighty quick
5694-64029-0017 the yankees marched over the hill out of sight
5694-64029-0018 we were ordered forward to the attack
5694-64029-0019 we were right upon the yankee line on the wilkerson turnpike
5694-64029-0020 we were not twenty yards off from the yankees and they were pouring the hot shot and shells right into our ranks and every man was yelling at the top of his voice cease firing you are firing on your own men cease firing you are firing on your own men
5694-64029-0021 oakley color bearer of the fourth tennessee regiment ran right up in the midst of the yankee line with his colors begging his men to follow
5694-64029-0022 the leaden hail storm swept them off the field they fell back and re formed
5694-64029-0023 we were at that time at least a hundred yards in advance of the brigade cheatham all the time calling upon the men to come on
5694-64029-0024 i saw and felt that he was not fighting for glory but that he was fighting for his country because he loved that country and he was willing to give his life for his country and the success of our cause
5694-64029-0025 i thought it had been torn from my shoulder
5694-64029-0026 as i went back to the field hospital i overtook another man walking along
5694-64029-0027 i looked at it pretty close and i said great god
5694-64029-0028 he was walking along when all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan
5694-64029-0029 but i could not bear the thought of wearing dead men's shoes
5694-64029-0030 he was stone dead but i dropped that foot quick
5694-64029-0031 before we arrived at the house we saw a body of yankees approaching and as we started to run back they fired upon us
5694-64029-0032 our pickets had run in and reported a night attack
6295-64301-0000 one winter evening as soon as his work was over for the day joseph locked the door of his smithy washed himself well put on clean clothes and taking his violin set out for testbridge mary was expecting him to tea
6295-64301-0001 it was the afternoon of a holiday and she had closed early
6295-64301-0002 was there ever a happier man than joseph that night as he strode along the footpath
6295-64301-0003 he pressed his violin case to his heart as if it were a living thing that could know that he loved it
6295-64301-0004 earth was gone and heaven was all
6295-64301-0005 blessed am i here now my god and blessed shall i be there then
6295-64301-0006 when he reached the suburbs the light of homes was shining through curtains of all colors
6295-64301-0007 just then he was in no mood to think of the sorrows
6295-64301-0008 the nettle and the dock said joseph
6295-64301-0009 he was in a mood for music was he not
6295-64301-0010 he laid down his violin and seated himself where mary told him in her father's arm chair by the fire
6295-64301-0011 letty finding herself not quite equal to the emergency came in her turn to call mary she went as quietly as if she were leaving a tiresome visitor
6295-64301-0012 the music was broken and joseph left alone with the dumb instruments
6295-64301-0013 but in his hands solitude and a violin were sure to marry in music
6295-64301-0014 they sat down and listened in silence
6295-64301-0015 her heart seemed to swell up into her throat and it was all she could do to keep from weeping
6295-64301-0016 a little longer and she was compelled to yield and the silent tears flowed freely
6295-64301-0017 letty too was overcome more than ever she had been by music
6295-64301-0018 let but a mood be strong enough and the soul clothing itself in that mood as with a garment can walk abroad and haunt the world
6295-64301-0019 it cried aloud that eternity was very long and like a great palace without a quiet room
6295-64301-0020 nor was this exactly the shape the thing took to the consciousness of the musician
6295-64301-0021 i love thee i love thee cried the violin and the worship was entreaty that knew not itself
6295-64301-0022 hast thou yet to learn that the love of the human is love is divine is but a lower form of a part of the love of god
6295-64301-0023 when thou lovest man or woman or child yea or even dog aright then wilt thou no longer need that i tell thee how god and his christ would not be content with each other alone in the glories even of the eternal original love because they could create more love
6295-64301-0024 he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how shall he love god whom he hath not seen
6295-64301-0025 a sob like a bird new born burst from mary's bosom
6295-64301-0026 that enchantment had possessed him usurping as it were the throne of his life and displacing it when it ceased he was not his own master
6295-64301-0027 he started to conscious confusion only neither knowing where he was nor what he did
6295-64301-0028 how it happened he never could tell but he brought down his violin with a crash against the piano then somehow stumbled and all but fell
6295-64301-0029 in the act of recovering himself he heard the neck of his instrument part from the body with a tearing discordant cry like the sound of the ruin of a living world
6295-64301-0030 his violin was broken but his being was made whole
6295-64301-0031 his treasure taken type of his self and a woman given him instead
6295-64301-0032 it's just like him he murmured
6313-66125-0000 you'll all be over if you don't have a care
6313-66125-0001 looks like a clump of bushes down there but i ain't sure can you make it out
6313-66125-0002 yes agreed tad that does look like bushes
6313-66125-0003 don't move around lie perfectly still warned the guide are you hurt
6313-66125-0004 and that tumble's enough to knock the sense out of a full grown man
6313-66125-0005 i could not think of allowing any of my charges to take so terrible a risk and
6313-66125-0006 no i am the lighter of the two urged tad
6313-66125-0007 i am the one to go after walt if anyone has to i'll go down mister thomas
6313-66125-0008 master tad is right decided the guide gazing at the two boys approvingly
6313-66125-0009 i protest shouted the professor
6313-66125-0010 you'd have both of us at the bottom if i left it to you to take care of this end
6313-66125-0011 be sure to fasten him securely to the loop before you give the signal to haul up warned the guide
6313-66125-0012 are you ready yes
6313-66125-0013 he tilted his head to look up
6313-66125-0014 the movement sent his body swaying giddily from side to side
6313-66125-0015 cautiously placing a hand against the rocks to steady himself tad wisely concluded that hereafter it would not pay to be too curious
6313-66125-0016 slowly but steadily the slender line was paid out amid a tense silence on the part of the little group at the top of the canyou
6313-66125-0017 after what seemed to them hours a sharp call from the depths reached their ears
6313-66125-0018 lige quickly made fast the line to a tree
6313-66125-0019 i see him called tad his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above
6313-66125-0020 he's so far to the right of me that i can't reach him
6313-66125-0021 lodged in the branches of a pinyon tree i think it is but he doesn't answer me
6313-66125-0022 lige leaning over the brink was able to follow the boy's movements by the aid of the thin arc of light made by the torch in tad's hand
6313-66125-0023 but from the cautious movements of the light far below them the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability
6313-66125-0024 mebby you think he's having some sort of a picnic down there eh glared lige
6313-66125-0025 shall we haul up asked lige making a megaphone of his hands yes haul away
6313-66125-0026 sure thing answered the boy
6313-66125-0027 nor was his sense of security increased when in shifting his position the torch fell from his grasp the fagots scattering as they slipped down between the limbs of the tree and whirling in ever diminishing circles until finally he heard them clatter on the rocks below
2277-149897-0000 when hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever
2277-149897-0001 he could hardly realise how it had all come about
2277-149897-0002 no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning
2277-149897-0003 he saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
2277-149897-0004 he was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him
2277-149897-0005 it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got an envelope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
2277-149897-0006 then he called harry the boy of all work around the place
2277-149897-0007 you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to missus hurstwood yes sir said the boy
2277-149897-0008 any answer i guess not
2277-149897-0009 the boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings
2277-149897-0010 he was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it
2277-149897-0011 she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
2277-149897-0012 if he only had that letter back he wouldn't send it
2277-149897-0013 for relief he arose and joined in conversation with a few friends who were drinking
2277-149897-0014 all the time his thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being therein enacted
2277-149897-0015 in about an hour and three quarters the boy returned
2277-149897-0016 he fancied as he sat at his desk that nothing would be done for a week or two meanwhile he would have time to think
2277-149897-0017 how about that now his pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to this subject
2277-149897-0018 he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
2277-149897-0019 three o'clock came four five six and no letter
2277-149897-0020 the helpless manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat
2277-149897-0021 he saw a busy saturday ushered out the sabbath in and nothing done
2277-149897-0022 all day the bar being closed he brooded alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carrie and without the ability to alter his condition one iota
2277-149897-0023 it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
2277-149897-0024 it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
2277-149897-0025 he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy
2277-149897-0026 he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
2277-149897-0027 he would go to her and tell her all his family complications
2277-149897-0028 he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her
2277-149897-0029 he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carrie but when he got in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
2277-149897-0030 he did not go within a block of the house
2277-149897-0031 he troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody
2277-149897-0032 he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked
2277-149897-0033 on wednesday he received another polite note from mc gregor james and hay it read
2277-149897-0034 dear sir we beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until to morrow thursday at one o'clock before filing suit against you on behalf of missus julia hurstwood for divorce and alimony
2277-149897-0035 very truly yours et cetera compromise
2277-149897-0036 so here it was spread out clear before him and now he knew what to expect
2277-149897-0037 if he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly
3000-15664-0000 shasta rambles and modoc memories
3000-15664-0001 arctic beauty and desolation with their blessings and dangers all may be found here to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warm fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank of flowers
3000-15664-0002 perhaps the profession of doing good may be full but every body should be kind at least to himself
3000-15664-0003 go quietly alone no harm will befall you
3000-15664-0004 but it is far better to go afoot
3000-15664-0005 one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego the pleasure and burden altogether as wood for fires is everywhere abundant
3000-15664-0006 only a little food will be required
3000-15664-0007 thus one saunters on and on in the glorious radiance in utter peace and forgetfulness of time
3000-15664-0008 yet strange to say there are days even here somewhat dull looking when the mountain seems uncommunicative sending out no appreciable invitation as if not at home
3000-15664-0009 at such time its height seems much less as if crouching and weary it were taking rest
3000-15664-0010 every crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever in a vital whirl and rush and though many feet and wings are folded how many are astir
3000-15664-0011 slight rainstorms are likely to be encountered in a trip round the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath well thatched trees that shed the rain like a roof
3000-15664-0012 then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst of bird song from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chaparral
3000-15664-0013 a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finely blended they seem a part of the night itself and make a deeper silence
3000-15664-0014 in setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off to the northwestward a few miles you may see
3000-15664-0015 in approaching it its suspicious looking yellow spotted hood and watchful attitude will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it stands as if you were approaching a dangerous snake
3000-15664-0016 it is lined with emerald algae and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn bushes which give it a fine setting
3000-15664-0017 it is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevation of about nine thousand five hundred feet above sea level in moraine sprinkled ice cliffs sixty feet high
3000-15664-0018 the long gray slopes leading up to the glacier seem remarkably smooth and unbroken
3000-15664-0019 most of the drainage of the glacier vanishes at once in the porous rocks to reappear in springs in the distant valley and it is only in time of flood that the channel carries much water then there are several fine falls in the gorge six hundred feet or more in height
3000-15664-0020 tracing this wild changing channel gorge gully or canyon the sections will show mount shasta as a huge palimpsest containing the records layer upon layer of strangely contrasted events in its fiery icy history
3000-15664-0021 regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit you pass through a belt of juniper woods called the cedars to sheep rock at the foot of the shasta pass
3000-15664-0022 here you strike the old emigrant road which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain
3000-15664-0023 mount bremer is the most noted stronghold of the sheep in the whole shasta region
3000-15664-0024 large flocks dwell here from year to year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plains and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain at every alarm
3000-15664-0025 while traveling with a company of hunters i saw about fifty in one flock
3000-15664-0026 the mule deer are nearly as heavy
3000-15664-0027 their long massive ears give them a very striking appearance
3000-15664-0028 but neither the glorified woods on the one hand nor the lake on the other could at first hold the eye
3000-15664-0029 then fell the gloaming making everything still more forbidding and mysterious
3000-15664-0030 then darkness like death
3000-15664-0031 two or three miles farther on is the main stronghold of the modocs held by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack
3000-15664-0032 the ducks less wary kept their places merely swimming in and out through openings in the rushes rippling the glassy water and raising spangles in their wake
3000-15664-0033 they are broad rugged crevassed cloudlike masses of down grinding ice pouring forth streams of muddy water as measures of the work they are doing in sculpturing the rocks beneath them very unlike the long majestic glaciers of alaska that riverlike go winding down the valleys through the forests to the sea
3000-15664-0034 thus the shasta river issues from a large lake like spring in shasta valley and about two thirds of the volume of the mc cloud gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base
3000-15664-0035 should the volume of the stream where you strike it seem small then you will know that you are above the spring if large nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the pitt river then you are below it and in either case have only to follow the river up or down until you come to it
3000-15664-0036 under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at a distance of half a mile or even more or you may not hear it until within a few rods
3000-15664-0037 the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking and colors the entire stream with the exception of the portions broken into foam
3000-15664-0038 asplenium epilobium heuchera hazel dogwood and alder make a luxurious fringe and setting and the forests of douglas spruce along the banks are the finest i have ever seen in the sierra
3000-15664-0039 tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travels
3000-15664-0040 as the life blood of the landscapes the best of the wilderness comes to their banks and not one dull passage is found in all their eventful histories
3000-15664-0041 tracing the mc cloud to its highest springs and over the divide to the fountains of fall river near fort crook thence down that river to its confluence with the pitt on from there to the volcanic region about lassen's butte through the big meadows among the sources of the feather river and down through forests of sugar pine to the fertile plains of chico this is a glorious saunter and imposes no hardship
3000-15664-0042 the ascent of lassen's butte is an easy walk and the views from the summit are extremely telling
3000-15664-0043 the lofty icy shasta towering high above all seems but an hour's walk from you though the distance in an air line is about sixty miles
3000-15664-0044 the big meadows lie near the foot of lassen's butte a beautiful spacious basin set in the heart of the richly forested mountains scarcely surpassed in the grandeur of its surroundings by tahoe
3000-15664-0045 the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction and everything destructible in them is being destroyed
3000-15664-0046 every landscape low and high seems doomed to be trampled and harried
5338-24615-0000 it was about noon when captain waverley entered the straggling village or rather hamlet of tully veolan close to which was situated the mansion of the proprietor
5338-24615-0001 the houses seemed miserable in the extreme especially to an eye accustomed to the smiling neatness of english cottages
5338-24615-0002 occasionally indeed when such a consummation seemed inevitable a watchful old grandam with her close cap distaff and spindle rushed like a sibyl in frenzy out of one of these miserable cells dashed into the middle of the path and snatching up her own charge from among the sunburnt loiterers saluted him with a sound cuff and transported him back to his dungeon the little white headed varlet screaming all the while from the very top of his lungs a shrilly treble to the growling remonstrances of the enraged matron
5338-24615-0003 the evil and remedy such as it is still exist but this is remote from our present purpose and is only thrown out for consideration of the collectors under mister dent's dog bill
5338-24615-0004 yet the physiognomy of the people when more closely examined was far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity their features were rough but remarkably intelligent grave but the very reverse of stupid and from among the young women an artist might have chosen more than one model whose features and form resembled those of minerva
5338-24615-0005 this avenue was straight and of moderate length running between a double row of very ancient horse chestnuts planted alternately with sycamores which rose to such huge height and nourished so luxuriantly that their boughs completely over arched the broad road beneath
5338-24615-0006 it was one of those effects which a painter loves to represent and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the boughs of the shady arch that vaulted the broad green alley
5338-24615-0007 the house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steep roofed buildings projecting from each other at right angles formed one side of the inclosure
5338-24615-0008 it had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary and when the scottish architects had not yet acquired the art of designing a domestic residence
5338-24615-0009 neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger
5338-24615-0010 stables and other offices occupied another side of the square
5338-24615-0011 two battlemented walls one of which faced the avenue and the other divided the court from the garden completed the inclosure
5338-24615-0012 this work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round
5338-24615-0013 the court was spacious well paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter
5338-24615-0014 everything around appeared solitary and would have been silent but for the continued plashing of the fountain and the whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy of waverley had conjured up
7976-110523-0000 he had little enough to break or bite and once when there was a great famine in the land he could hardly procure even his daily bread and as he lay thinking in his bed one night he sighed and said to his wife what will become of us
7976-110523-0001 how can we feed our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves
7976-110523-0002 oh you simpleton said she then we must all four die of hunger you had better plane the coffins for us
7976-110523-0003 but she left him no peace till he consented saying ah but i shall miss the poor children
7976-110523-0004 and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went out
7976-110523-0005 ah father said hansel i am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good bye
7976-110523-0006 but in reality hansel was not looking at a cat but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path
7976-110523-0007 but her husband felt heavy at heart and thought it were better to share the last crust with the children
7976-110523-0008 early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed and gave them each a slice of bread which was still smaller than the former piece
7976-110523-0009 we are going into the forest to hew wood and in the evening when we are ready we will come and fetch you again
7976-110523-0010 hansel thought the roof tasted very nice and so he tore off a great piece while grethel broke a large round pane out of the window and sat down quite contentedly
7976-110523-0011 come in and stop with me and no harm shall come to you and so saying she took them both by the hand and led them into her cottage
7976-110523-0012 the old woman behaved very kindly to them but in reality she was a wicked old witch who way laid children and built the breadhouse in order to entice them in but as soon as they were in her power she killed them cooked and ate them and made a great festival of the day
7976-110523-0013 then she took up hansel with her rough hand and shut him up in a little cage with a lattice door and although he screamed loudly it was of no use
7976-110523-0014 grethel began to cry but it was all useless for the old witch made her do as she wanted
7976-110523-0015 grethel she cried in a passion get some water quickly be hansel fat or lean this morning i will kill and cook him
7976-110523-0016 dear good god help us now she prayed
7976-110523-0017 creep in said the witch and see if it is hot enough and then we will put in the bread but she intended when grethel got in to shut up the oven and let her bake so that she might eat her as well as hansel
7976-110523-0018 see i could even get in myself
7976-110523-0019 and she got up and put her head into the oven
7976-110523-0020 and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witch's house where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones
7976-110523-0021 then they began to run and rushing into the house they fell upon their father's neck
3853-163249-0000 her meeting with letty was indescribably tender and the days that followed were pretty equally divided between her and her brother in nursing the one and loving the other
3853-163249-0001 but even while she enjoyed every hour of life and begrudged the time given to sleep she felt as if the dream was too beautiful to last and often said
3853-163249-0002 so christie turned a deaf ear to her prophetic soul and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that had come at last
3853-163249-0003 nothing can surprise me now i'm prepared for any thing even the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a jig
3853-163249-0004 i feel like a boy out of school or rather a man out of prison and must enjoy my liberty in some way
3853-163249-0005 i'm not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it
3853-163249-0006 i don't want you to i love to see you so young and happy only you are not the old david and i've got to get acquainted with the new one
3853-163249-0007 i hope you'll like him better than the frost bitten old david you first knew and were kind enough to love
3853-163249-0008 mother says i've gone back to the time before we lost letty and i sometimes feel as if i had
3853-163249-0009 in that case you will find me a proud impetuous ambitious fellow christie and how will that suit
3853-163249-0010 excellently i like pride of your sort impetuosity becomes you for you have learned to control it if need be and the ambition is best of all
3853-163249-0011 i shall wait for time to show
3853-163249-0012 then they went back to their work little dreaming as they tied roses and twined smilax wreaths how near that other chance was how soon they were to be called upon to keep their promise and how well each was to perform the part given them in life and death
3853-163249-0013 to no home in the land did the great trouble bring a more sudden change than the little cottage in the lane
3853-163249-0014 david was sober enough now and went about his work with a grim set to his lips and a spark in his eyes that made the three women look at one another pale with unspoken apprehension
3853-163249-0015 it is terrible and yet glorious
3853-163249-0016 david held it close in both of his saying gratefully thank you mother then fixing his eyes on the younger yet not dearer women he added with a ring in his voice that made their hearts answer with a prompt ay ay in spite of love or fear
3853-163249-0017 the boys bless their brave hearts have done nobly but older men are needed now we cannot sacrifice all the gallant lads and we who have more to lose than they must take our turn and try to do as well
3853-163249-0018 yes david sister and sweetheart answered bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what heavy consequences god might see fit to send good
3853-163249-0019 bennet will take the garden and green house off my hands this autumn for a year or longer if i like
3853-163249-0020 he's a kind neighborly man and his boy will take my place about the house and protect you faithfully
3853-163249-0021 i knew you would go i saw you getting ready and i made up my mind to follow
3853-163249-0022 you will let me do it and in return i will marry you whenever you ask me answered christie sealing the promise with a kiss that silenced him
3853-163249-0023 you've something to tell me i see it in your face dear i must go
3853-163249-0024 next evening as missus sterling sat alone in the twilight a tall man in army blue entered quietly stood watching the tranquil figure for a moment then went and knelt down beside it saying with a most unsoldierly choke in the voice
3853-163249-0025 the loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much for their country
3853-163249-0026 it would have taken many knapsacks to hold all the gifts showered upon him by his friends and neighbors
3853-163249-0027 finding that lisha showed little enthusiasm on the subject she tried to rouse him by patriotic appeals of various sorts
3853-163249-0028 very well said missus wilkins resolutely to herself ef i can't make no impression on his soul i will on his stommick and see how that'll work
3853-163249-0029 we can't afford no nice vittles now when our men are sufferin so
3853-163249-0030 he was not as unmoved as he seemed by the general excitement and had felt sundry manly impulses to up and at em when his comrades in the shop discussed the crisis with ireful brandishing of awls and vengeful pounding of sole leather as if the rebels were under the hammer
3853-163249-0031 to say that the fish rose at once and swallowed the bait hook and all but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering man
3853-163249-0032 can you remember what hepsey told us and call them poor long sufferin creeters names
3853-163249-0033 no he ain't it's a trainer added ann lizy
3853-163249-0034 now cynthy be you satisfied
3853-163249-0035 and the inconsistent woman fell upon his buttony breast weeping copiously
3853-163249-0036 his wife fed him with the fat of the land regardless of consequences his children revolved about him with tireless curiosity and wonder his neighbors flocked in to applaud advise and admire every one treated him with a respect most grateful to his feelings he was an object of interest and with every hour his importance increased so that by night he felt like a commander in chief and bore himself accordingly
3853-163249-0037 then the good soul openly shouldered the burden she had borne so long in secret and bravely trudged on alone
3853-163249-0038 the women dropped their work to look and listen for his visits were few and short and every instant was precious
3853-163249-0039 they knew what it was without a word missus sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head
3853-163249-0040 now let's be brave and enjoy every minute of it
3853-163249-0041 we will what can i do for you davy asked christie wonderfully supported by the thought that she was going too
3853-163249-0042 as a married woman you will get on better as my wife you will be allowed to come to me if i need you and as my he stopped there for he could not add as my widow you will have my pension to support you
3853-163249-0043 nothing can part us any more not even death for love like ours will last for ever
3853-163249-0044 not one david that's true love christie
3853-163249-0045 then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can utter
3853-163249-0046 surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i know that my heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet when my courage fails as it will by and by and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over
3853-163249-0047 david caught the exaltation and gave no further thought to any thing but the duty of the hour finding himself stronger and braver for that long look into the illuminated face of the woman he loved
3853-163249-0048 the roses are for they remind me of poor helen and the first work i did with david was arranging flowers like these for a dead baby's little coffin
3853-163249-0049 but i think few brides dress with a braver happier heart than mine though i do choose a sober wedding gown answered christie smiling again as she took from a half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft gray woollen stuff
3853-163249-0050 mister power is waiting are you ready love quite ready
3853-163249-0051 you young folks take a wedding trip to the green house while we see how well we can get on without you
3853-163249-0052 david and christie went smiling away together and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts
3853-163249-0053 a very simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts and better than any speech or song was letty's broken whisper as she folded her arms round david's empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us
3853-163249-0054 all watched with quickened breath and proud souls that living wave blue below and bright with a steely glitter above as it flowed down the street and away to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for months had rolled up against the south and ebbed back reddened with the blood of men like these
3853-163249-0055 then she saw david and the regiment became one man to her
3853-163249-0056 i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more
2078-142845-0000 kirkleatham yeast
2078-142845-0001 seventeen seventeen
2078-142845-0002 to make good home made bread
2078-142845-0003 seventeen eighteen
2078-142845-0004 mode put the flour into a large earthenware bowl or deep pan then with a strong metal or wooden spoon hollow out the middle but do not clear it entirely away from the bottom of the pan as in that case the sponge or leaven as it was formerly termed would stick to it which it ought not to do
2078-142845-0005 next take either a large tablespoonful of brewer's yeast which has been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water and letting it afterwards stand to settle for a day and night or nearly an ounce of german yeast put it into a large basin and proceed to mix it so that it shall be as smooth as cream with three quarters pint of warm milk and water or with water only though even a very little milk will much improve the bread
2078-142845-0006 look at it from time to time when it has been laid for nearly an hour and when the yeast has risen and broken through the flour so that bubbles appear in it you will know that it is ready to be made up into dough
2078-142845-0007 then place the pan on a strong chair or dresser or table of convenient height pour into the sponge the remainder of the warm milk and water stir into it as much of the flour as you can with the spoon then wipe it out clean with your fingers and lay it aside
2078-142845-0008 turn it then on to a paste board or very clean dresser and with a large sharp knife divide it in two make it up quickly into loaves and dispatch it to the oven make one or two incisions across the tops of the loaves as they will rise more easily if this be done
2078-142845-0009 illustration italian millet
2078-142845-0010 italian millet or great indian millet is cultivated in egypt and nubia where it is called dhourra and is used as human food as well as for the fermentation of beer
2078-142845-0011 it will grow on poor soils and is extremely productive
2078-142845-0012 it has been introduced into italy where they make a coarse bread from it and it is also employed in pastry and puddings they also use it for feeding horses and domestic fowls
2078-142845-0013 a yellow variety called golden millet is sold in the grocers shops for making puddings and is very delicate and wholesome
2078-142845-0014 another advantage the red wheats possess is their comparative immunity from the attacks of mildew and fly
2078-142845-0015 mode boil the rice in water until it is quite tender pour off the water and put the rice before it is cold to the flour
2078-142845-0016 illustration maize plant
2078-142845-0017 maize next to wheat and rice maize is the grain most used in the nourishment of man
2078-142845-0018 if carried any distance it should be stored away in air tight vessels
2078-142845-0019 some of the preparations of maize flour are very good and when partaken in moderation suitable food for almost everybody
2078-142845-0020 mode let the tartaric acid and salt be reduced to the finest possible powder then mix them well with the flour
2078-142845-0021 sour milk or buttermilk may be used but then a little less acid will be needed
2078-142845-0022 excellent rolls
2078-142845-0023 hot rolls
2078-142845-0024 seventeen twenty four
2078-142845-0025 when they are quite hot divide them lengthwise into three put some thin flakes of good butter between the slices press the rolls together and put them in the oven for a minute or two but not longer or the butter would oil take them out of the oven spread the butter equally over divide the rolls in half and put them on to a very hot clean dish and send them instantly to table
2078-142845-0026 to make dry toast
2078-142845-0027 never use new bread for making any kind of toast as it eats heavy and besides is very extravagant
2078-142845-0028 move it backwards and forwards until the bread is nicely coloured then turn it and toast the other side and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens
2078-142845-0029 to make hot buttered toast seventeen twenty six
2078-142845-0030 a loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast better than cottage bread the latter not being a good shape and too crusty for the purpose
2078-142845-0031 cut as many nice even slices as may be required rather more than one quarter inch in thickness and toast them before a very bright fire without allowing the bread to blacken which spoils the appearance and flavour of all toast
2078-142845-0032 soyer recommends that each slice should be cut into pieces as soon as it is buttered and when all are ready that they should be piled lightly on the dish they are intended to be served on
2078-142845-0033 he says that by cutting through four or five slices at a time all the butter is squeezed out of the upper ones while the bottom one is swimming in fat liquid
2078-142845-0034 muffins and crumpets should always be served on separate dishes and both toasted and served as expeditiously as possible
2078-142845-0035 sufficient allow two crumpets to each person
2078-142845-0036 plain buns seventeen twenty nine
2078-142845-0037 mode put the flour into a basin mix the sugar well with it make a hole in the centre and stir in the yeast and milk which should be lukewarm with enough of the flour to make it the thickness of cream
2078-142845-0038 from fifteen to twenty minutes will be required to bake them nicely
2078-142845-0039 these buns may be varied by adding a few currants candied peel or caraway seeds to the other ingredients and the above mixture answers for hot cross buns by putting in a little ground allspice and by pressing a tin mould in the form of a cross in the centre of the bun
2078-142845-0040 sufficient to make twelve buns seasonable at any time light buns
2078-142845-0041 illustration buns

2078-142845-0043 mode whisk the egg stir in the sugar and beat these ingredients well together beat the butter to a cream stir in the ground rice currants and candied peel and as much flour as will make it of such a consistency that it may be rolled into seven or eight balls
2078-142845-0044 italian rusks
2078-142845-0045 they should be kept in a closed tin canister in a dry place to preserve their crispness
2078-142845-0046 it is not cultivated in england being principally confined to the east
2078-142845-0047 when we take into account that the arabians are fond of lizards and locusts as articles of food their cuisine altogether is scarcely a tempting one
2078-142845-0048 seventeen thirty four
2078-142845-0049 illustration rusks
2078-142845-0050 mode put the milk and butter into a saucepan and keep shaking it round until the latter is melted
2078-142845-0051 when cold they should be put into tin canisters to keep them dry and if intended for the cheese course the sifted sugar should be omitted
422-122949-0000 every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiring slavery in some form or other
422-122949-0001 the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts
422-122949-0002 we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves
422-122949-0003 it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised
422-122949-0004 he honours whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals self glorification
422-122949-0005 probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation
422-122949-0006 here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised
422-122949-0007 according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being
422-122949-0008 everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good and stupid
422-122949-0009 or he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honour them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others even in cases where i do not share it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity
422-122949-0010 in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ampler and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger
422-122949-0011 the most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto been victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone it develops to maturity
422-122949-0012 variations whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or deteriorations and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dares to be individual and detach himself
422-122949-0013 at this turning point of history there manifest themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a magnificent manifold virgin forest like up growth and up striving a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary decay and self destruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms which strive with one another for sun and light and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality
422-122949-0014 nothing but new whys nothing but new hows no common formulas any longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay deterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad a portentous simultaneousness of spring and autumn full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still inexhausted still unwearied corruption
422-122949-0015 danger is again present the mother of morality great danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbour and friend into the street into their own child into their own heart into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions
422-122949-0016 what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach
422-122949-0017 this is the problem of race
422-122949-0018 in our very democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul
422-122949-0019 the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a designation for it he would say it is justice itself
422-122949-0020 on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations even when they use the same language or rather when people have lived long together under similar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil there originates therefrom an entity that understands itself namely a nation
422-122949-0021 the greater the danger the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse
422-122949-0022 also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of the other
422-122949-0023 whichever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and determine ultimately its list of desirable things
422-122949-0024 a man's estimates of value betray something of the structure of his soul and wherein it sees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs
422-122949-0025 profound suffering makes noble it separates one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which takes suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound
422-122949-0026 the highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint for it is just holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question
422-122949-0027 occasionally too the waking call comes too late the chance which gives permission to take action when their best youth and strength for action have been used up in sitting still and how many a one just as he sprang up has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy
422-122949-0028 and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases thee
422-122949-0029 only name it whatever i have i offer thee
422-122949-0030 but you misunderstand him when you complain about it
422-122949-0031 there must be a sort of repugnance in me to believe anything definite about myself is there perhaps some enigma therein
422-122949-0032 probably but fortunately nothing for my own teeth perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong but not to myself as is sufficiently agreeable to me but what has happened to you
422-122949-0033 i do not know he said hesitatingly perhaps the harpies have flown over my table
422-122949-0034 to suffocate with his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared the danger will always be great nowadays however it is extraordinarily so
422-122949-0035 and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice politeness
251-137823-0000 i'll be glad to try sir he replied
251-137823-0001 inside a secret rocket telemetering device was mounted on its test stand
251-137823-0002 this isn't part of your testing routine is it
251-137823-0003 another engineer rushed toward the door to see what was happening outside
251-137823-0004 electronic equipment cascaded from the wall shelves and a heavy duty chain hoist came loose from its overhead track plunging to the floor with a terrifying crash
251-137823-0005 an instant later it crashed over pinning mark faber beneath it
251-137823-0006 bud threw up his arms to protect himself but too late
251-137823-0007 for minutes no one stirred among the wreckage
251-137823-0008 then tom who had been stunned by some falling debris raised himself to a sitting position
251-137823-0009 tom's eyes focused in horror on the wreckage enveloped by still billowing dust
251-137823-0010 the sky was visible through several gaping holes in the roof which was sagging dangerously on its supporting trusses
251-137823-0011 the young inventor had just noticed his friend lying pinned beneath a heavy beam nearby
251-137823-0012 his friend's eyelids flickered
251-137823-0013 we'd better not try to move him tom decided we'll get an ambulance
251-137823-0014 they picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction
251-137823-0015 let's see about getting help for mister faber
251-137823-0016 and the only truck we had available was in that burning shed the superintendent added bitterly
251-137823-0017 anyhow we want to help got a job for us
251-137823-0018 within minutes tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings
251-137823-0019 the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harkness fire trucks three ambulances and private cars driven by volunteers
251-137823-0020 the two girls were as much upset as tom's mother tom laughed
251-137823-0021 mister swift came into the living room just then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been
251-137823-0022 he smiled guiltily as he added but i must admit i was more than a little concerned myself
251-137823-0023 he's a great scientist
251-137823-0024 tom nodded unhappily
251-137823-0025 male or female human or animal
251-137823-0026 mister swift's eyes twinkled
2035-152373-0000 throughout this century the power of the church was constantly on the increase and is visible in many important changes
2035-152373-0001 the ancestors of the present pretender congal surnamed the squint eyed had twice received and cherished the licentious bards when under the ban of tara and his popularity with that still powerful order was one prop of his ambition
2035-152373-0002 it is pretty clear also that the last rally of druidism against christianity took place behind his banner on the plain of moira
2035-152373-0003 the poets of succeeding ages have dwelt much in detail on the occurrences of this memorable day
2035-152373-0004 like the two kings of sparta they reigned jointly dividing between them the labours and cares of state
2035-152373-0005 it was the season when the ancient sun god had been accustomed to receive his annual oblations and we can well believe that those whose hearts still trembled at the name of bel must have connected the eclipse and the plague with the revolution in the national worship and the overthrow of the ancient gods on that plain of prostration where they had so long received the homage of an entire people
2035-152373-0006 lastly the royal brothers fell themselves victims to the epidemic which so sadly signalizes their reign
2035-152373-0007 the only conflicts that occurred on irish soil with a pictish or an anglo saxon force if we except those who formed a contingent of congal's army at moira occurred in the time of the hospitable finnacta
2035-152373-0008 as leading to the mention of other interesting events we must set this inroad clearly before the reader
2035-152373-0009 the saxons of kent and the southern kingdoms generally were converted by missionaries from france or rome or native preachers of the first or second christian generation those of northumbria recognise as their apostles saint aidan and saint cuthbert two fathers from iona
2035-152373-0010 the kingdom of northumbria as the name implies embraced nearly all the country from the humber to the pictish border
2035-152373-0011 the barren rock about three miles in length was covered with monastic buildings and its cemetery was already adorned with the tombs of saints and kings
2035-152373-0012 now every missionary that ever went out from iona had taught that to reduce christians to slavery was wholly inconsistent with a belief in the doctrines of the gospel
2035-152373-0013 while the liberated exiles rejoiced on the plain of meath the tent of the abbot of iona was pitched on the rath of tara a fact which would seem to indicate that already in little more than a century since the interdict had fallen on it the edifices which made so fine a show in the days of patrick were ruined and uninhabitable
2035-152373-0014 so slow and patient is the process by which christianity infuses itself into the social life of a converted people
2035-152373-0015 here the holy prelate of ferns met him and related a vision in which he had been instructed to demand the abolition of the impost
2035-152373-0016 the tribute was at this period enormous fifteen thousand head of cattle annually
2035-152373-0017 saint moling survived him three years and saint adamnan so intimately connected with his reign ten years
2035-152373-0018 nothing could be more natural than such an assembly in such a place at such a period
5694-64038-0000 advance into tennessee
5694-64038-0001 yank says what you doing johnny
5694-64038-0002 we passed around atlanta crossed the chattahoochee and traveled back over the same route on which we had made the arduous campaign under joe johnston
5694-64038-0003 outside of these occasional reminders we could see no evidence of the desolation of the track of an invading army
5694-64038-0004 we saw the united states flag flying from the ramparts and thought that yank would probably be asleep or catching lice or maybe engaged in a game of seven up
5694-64038-0005 he walked up and says hello boys what is it boss
5694-64038-0006 a yankee always says nager
5694-64038-0007 they persuaded eloquently
5694-64038-0008 a man in the well
5694-64038-0009 the voice appeared to be overhead
5694-64038-0010 right before me i saw the long dry grass all bending toward a common center and i knew that it was an old well and that my comrade had fallen in it
5694-64038-0011 but how to get him out was the unsolved problem
5694-64038-0012 the poor fellow stayed in that well all night
5694-64038-0013 we looked all around and thought that the coast was clear
5694-64038-0014 i don't think his gun was loaded though because we did not hear the ball whistle
5694-64038-0015 we walked over this floating bridge and soon found ourselves on the tennessee side of tennessee river
5694-64038-0016 we had beef for supper that night
5694-64038-0017 how every pulse did beat and leap and how every heart did throb with emotions of joy which seemed nearly akin to heaven when we received the glad intelligence of our onward march toward the land of promise and of our loved ones
5694-64038-0018 we were inured to privations and hardships had been upon every march in every battle in every skirmish in every advance in every retreat in every victory in every defeat
5694-64038-0019 he wanted to go by home and tell his wife and children good bye and to get his clothes it was no go
5694-64038-0020 but after awhile jim says gentlemen ay ganny the law
5694-64038-0021 you see jim knowed the law
5694-64038-0022 those old soldiers had long long ago forgotten about that old law of the long gone past but jim had treasured it up in his memory lo these many years and he thought it would serve him now as it had no doubt frequently done in the past
5694-64038-0023 the third day it was reported that the yankees had taken position on the murfreesboro pike
5694-64038-0024 a regiment was sent to the attack it was jim's regiment
5694-64038-0025 he hadn't seen anything to shoot at but he blazed away he loaded and fired the second time when they were ordered to retreat
6313-66129-0000 he no doubt would bring food of some kind with him
6313-66129-0001 with a shout the boys dashed pell mell to meet the pack train and falling in behind the slow moving burros urged them on with derisive shouts and sundry resounding slaps on the animals flanks
6313-66129-0002 cold water is the most nourishing thing we've touched since last night
6313-66129-0003 we did not it must have come to life some time during the night and dug its way out laughed tad
6313-66129-0004 and we've got a surprise for you announced stacy swelling with pride
6313-66129-0005 jam exclaimed chunky stretching his neck and eyeing the dish longingly
6313-66129-0006 now fall to young gentlemen directed the professor
6313-66129-0007 i am free to admit that i am hungry too
6313-66129-0008 he buried his biscuit under a layer of jam over which he spread a thick coating of honey
6313-66129-0009 president brown i withdraw my criticism i offer you my humble apologies
6313-66129-0010 i reckon there are smiled the guide we are in the bear country now
6313-66129-0011 yes the country is full of caves
6313-66129-0012 this announcement filled the boys with excitement
6313-66129-0013 but i know an old settler who will lend us his dog if it is not out
6313-66129-0014 supper having been finished the party gathered about the camp fire for their evening chat after which admonishing stacy to keep within his tent and not to go borrowing trouble the boys turned in for a sound sleep
6313-66129-0015 as yet they had been unable to attempt any fancy riding with their ponies owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying
6313-66129-0016 the boys were now all anxiety to start while the ponies after their sunday rest were almost as full of life as were their owners
6313-66129-0017 the little animals were becoming more sure footed every day and ned said that before the trip was finished jimmie would be able to walk a slack rope
6313-66129-0018 an early start was made so that the party reached the promised table lands shortly before ten o'clock in the forenoon
6313-66129-0019 a temporary camp was quickly pitched
6313-66129-0020 the great green field surrounded on all sides by tall trees made the place an ideal one for their purpose
6313-66129-0021 it was a beautiful race the little indian ponies seeming to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest stretching themselves out to their full lengths and with heads on a level with their backs fairly flew across the great plot of green
6313-66129-0022 all agreed that tad's superior horsemanship alone had won the race for him
6313-66129-0023 galloping into camp the boy fetched his sombrero which he carried well out into the field and tossed away
6313-66129-0024 then bidding the boys ride up near the spot to watch him he drew off some ten rods and wheeling spurred his pony to a run
6313-66129-0025 grasping the pommel with the left hand he appeared to dive head first toward the ground
6313-66129-0026 they saw his long hair almost brush the grass one of his hands swept down and up and once more tad butler rose standing in his stirrups uttering a cowboy yell as he waved the sombrero on high
6313-66129-0027 the boys howled with delight that is all did save stacy brown
6313-66129-0028 tad is an experienced rider
6313-66129-0029 the first time he rode swiftly by it leaning over to look at the hat as he passed holding to the pommel firmly with his left hand
6313-66129-0030 what's that for demanded ned wonderingly
6313-66129-0031 hat too close to me i couldn't get it explained chunky the boys roared
6313-66129-0032 why don't you move the pony
6313-66129-0033 once more stacy approached the sombrero his pony running well and as he drew near it they saw him rise in his saddle just as tad butler had done a few minutes before
6313-66129-0034 at the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup he threw his body sharply to the right reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel
6313-66129-0035 as a result instead of stopping when he reached the hat the boy kept on going
6241-66616-0000 but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the loved ones of their own firesides close about them was the whole picture revealed
6241-66616-0001 one dark night at the head of a score of his tribe he fell upon wabigoon's camp his object being the abduction of the princess
6241-66616-0002 while the attack was successful in a way its main purpose failed
6241-66616-0003 a counter attack was made upon woonga and he was driven deep into the wilderness with great loss
6241-66616-0004 three days later minnetaki became newsome's wife at the hudson bay post
6241-66616-0005 from that hour dated one of the most sanguinary feuds in the history of the great trading company a feud which as we shall see was destined to live even unto the second generation
6241-66616-0006 meanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of newsome and his lovely indian wife
6241-66616-0007 the other was a girl three years younger and newsome insisted that she be called minnetaki
6241-66616-0008 curiously enough the blood of wabi ran almost pure to his indian forefathers while minnetaki as she became older developed less of the wild beauty of her mother and more of the softer loveliness of the white race her wealth of soft jet black hair and her great dark eyes contrasting with the lighter skin of her father's blood
6241-66616-0009 wabi on the other hand was an indian in appearance from his moccasins to the crown of his head swarthy sinewy as agile as a lynx and with every instinct in him crying for the life of the wild
6241-66616-0010 one of newsome's chief pleasures in life had been the educating of his woodland bride and it was the ambition of both that the little minnetaki and her brother be reared in the ways of white children
6241-66616-0011 consequently both mother and father began their education at the post they were sent to the factor's school and two winters were passed in port arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equipped schools
6241-66616-0012 the children proved themselves unusually bright pupils and by the time wabi was sixteen and minnetaki twelve one would not have known from their manner of speech that indian blood ran in their veins
6241-66616-0013 it was at about this time in their lives that the woongas became especially daring in their depredations
6241-66616-0014 at last so daring did he become that the provincial government placed a price upon his head and upon those of a number of his most notorious followers
6241-66616-0015 but each week added to his loneliness and his longings for minnetaki and his forests
6241-66616-0016 necessity had become his grim master and the following week he was going to work
6241-66616-0017 a thousand plans were made a thousand adventures pictured and the mother would smile and laugh and plan with them
6241-66616-0018 but in time the end of it all came and wabi went back to the princess mother to minnetaki and to his forests
6241-66616-0019 there were tears in the boys eyes when they parted and the mother cried for the indian boy who was returning to his people
6241-66616-0020 spring came and passed and then summer
6241-66616-0021 we shall make more money up here this winter than you could earn in detroit in three years
6241-66616-0022 we will hunt wolves the country is alive with them and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scalp taken
6241-66616-0023 three weeks later came wabigoon's reply
6241-66616-0024 on the tenth of october he would meet rod at sprucewood on the black sturgeon river
6241-66616-0025 there was little time to lose in making preparations and the fourth day following the receipt of wabi's letter found rod and his mother waiting for the train which was to whirl the boy into his new life
7976-110124-0000 long ago there lived a merchant who had three daughters
7976-110124-0001 every year at a certain day of a certain month he went away to a distant city to collect money on an account
7976-110124-0002 how do you know asked their father i am older and wiser than you are and i know that there are many evils which might come upon you
7976-110124-0003 when it was evening he led his band into a nearby street and in his disguise approached the merchant's house he knocked at the door
7976-110124-0004 have pity upon a poor unfortunate one he called out
7976-110124-0005 let me enter i pray you to pass the night under your roof
7976-110124-0006 it's surely a terrible storm outside said the merchant's eldest daughter as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows
7976-110124-0007 he is old as well as poor she said
7976-110124-0008 if we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it
7976-110124-0009 bui we should not forget our promise to our father cried the youngest daughter
7976-110124-0010 however in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar
7976-110124-0011 it is a fearful night to send away a beggar said the eldest sister while they were eating
7976-110124-0012 while they were talking the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them
7976-110124-0013 the two eldest ate their apples but the youngest could not eat that night she threw the apple away
7976-110124-0014 she did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work
7976-110124-0015 then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store
7976-110124-0016 it was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chieftain
7976-110124-0017 perhaps you can outwit her yet cried another
7976-110124-0018 the merchant's daughter at first did not answer but as he kept on calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted
7976-110124-0019 i promise you i will do you no harm
7976-110124-0020 you shall not come into my father's house
7976-110124-0021 pass the charm out to me then said the robber
7976-110124-0022 when she returned his hand was sticking through the hole in the door
7976-110124-0023 the cries and curses of the robbers filled the air
7976-110124-0024 they tried in vain to break down the great doors
7976-110124-0025 all my worries about you were foolish
84-121123-0000 go do you hear
84-121123-0001 but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight
84-121123-0002 at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry
84-121123-0003 and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence
84-121123-0004 d'avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative
84-121123-0005 d'avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man
84-121123-0006 for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers
84-121123-0007 what do you mean sir
84-121123-0008 oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken i rave
84-121123-0009 do you know the assassin asked morrel
84-121123-0010 noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention
84-121123-0011 said morrel sadly yes replied noirtier
84-121123-0012 the old man's eyes remained fixed on the door
84-121123-0013 asked morrel yes
84-121123-0014 must i leave alone no
84-121123-0015 but can he understand you yes
84-121123-0016 gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back
84-121123-0017 my father has revealed the culprit's name my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret do you not father
84-121123-0018 morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him
84-121123-0019 the old man made a sign in the affirmative
84-121123-0020 it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks
84-121123-0021 but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber
84-121123-0022 the two doctors therefore entered the room alone
84-121123-0023 noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse
84-121123-0024 the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips
84-121123-0025 the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbe who lives next door to you shall i call on him as i pass
84-121123-0026 d'avrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child's room do you wish to see him
84-121123-0027 i only wish to be alone you will excuse me will you not
84-121123-0028 i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine
2428-83705-0000 her father is a most remarkable person to say the least
2428-83705-0001 but it is quite plain to me that all the arrangements for my wedding are going to be made by the snellings
2428-83705-0002 i do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldn't be at all surprised to learn that all mary ann's things had been already bought and perhaps some of them marked
2428-83705-0003 it is most delightful
2428-83705-0004 it might just as well be some one else's wedding so unimportant is the part which i am set to play in it
2428-83705-0005 for instance look at their behaviour in the matter of the ring
2428-83705-0006 the accident in question occurred upon the sunday evening
2428-83705-0007 the girl is fretting but you don't seem to notice it
2428-83705-0008 i gasped positively gasped
2428-83705-0009 that's it on your account
2428-83705-0010 from a cousin of ours who's in that line
2428-83705-0011 i never saw people like the snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of lines
2428-83705-0012 i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of mary ann's engagement ring but i handed over the amount
2428-83705-0013 it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs
2428-83705-0014 there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigstye for all i know
2428-83705-0015 when she heard of my engagement with mary ann she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigstye and that i should pay her rent for it
2428-83705-0016 there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
2428-83705-0017 i found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
2428-83705-0018 it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year
2428-83705-0019 and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
2428-83705-0020 it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact
2428-83705-0021 i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
2428-83705-0022 a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush' and it will be something to have by us
2428-83705-0023 i know what mamma can afford to give and i will see she gives it
2428-83705-0024 and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either
2428-83705-0025 i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to give it won't be my fault if i don't get it
2428-83705-0026 of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can there's a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing
2428-83705-0027 hers has been prodigious
2428-83705-0028 she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
2428-83705-0029 i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
2428-83705-0030 the fact of having given mary ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me is inexplicable
2428-83705-0031 such is the selfishness of human nature
2428-83705-0032 but why on that account they should pity me i altogether fail to understand
2428-83705-0033 we have all been giving mary ann presents and i suppose you mister whiting have been giving her something too
2428-83705-0034 that was what missus macpherson said to me only the other day
2428-83705-0035 and what inquired missus macpherson has mary ann given you her love
2428-83705-0036 someone sniggered
2428-83705-0037 i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romance is dead at least in that circle of society in which the snellings move
2428-83705-0038 as it is unless i am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side and they know it
2428-83705-0039 p s the cards are out for the wedding
2428-83705-0040 we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france
2428-83705-0041 a second cousin of mary ann's is in the cook's tours line
2428-83705-0042 he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel it's a wedding present
2428-83705-0043 besides which we can always sell the coupons and railway passes which we don't use
5895-34629-0000 it was established at southwark
5895-34629-0001 the dome of saint paul's was a delight to ursus
5895-34629-0002 saint paul is a saint only with extenuating circumstances
5895-34629-0003 he entered heaven only by the artists door
5895-34629-0004 it might have been ordered for the green box
5895-34629-0005 it was a theatre ready made
5895-34629-0006 against this wall was placed the green box which they were able to draw into the yard owing to the height of the gate
5895-34629-0007 the placard gwynplaine the laughing man taken from its nail in the green box was hung up close to the sign of the inn
5895-34629-0008 by the side of the door was constructed off hand by means of an empty barrel a box for the money taker who was sometimes fibi and sometimes vinos
5895-34629-0009 we are in london said ursus we must be prepared for the gentry
5895-34629-0010 they began their performances
5895-34629-0011 with that exception their success became so great that no mountebank memory could recall its parallel
5895-34629-0012 all southwark ran in crowds to admire the laughing man
5895-34629-0013 the merry andrews and mountebanks of tarrinzeau field were aghast at gwynplaine
5895-34629-0014 gwynplaine ate up their public
5895-34629-0015 besides the small fry the swallowers of swords and the grimace makers real performances took place on the green
5895-34629-0016 even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success
5895-34629-0017 that success was prodigious still it remained local
5895-34629-0018 it took a hundred and thirty years for the name of shakespeare to penetrate from england into france
5895-34629-0019 the glory of gwynplaine had not passed london bridge
5895-34629-0020 these were remarkable talents
5895-34629-0021 besides this he harangued like cicero as we have just seen sold his drugs attended sickness and even healed the sick
5895-34629-0022 ursus was satisfied with the applause of southwark but by no means astonished
5895-34629-0023 at every performance the yard of the inn transformed into a pit was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience
5895-34629-0024 the emptying of tankards did not decrease their success
5895-34629-0025 this connoisseur was suddenly fascinated and had adopted the laughing man
5895-34629-0026 he did not come every evening but when he came he led the public applause grew into acclamation success rose not to the roof for there was none but to the clouds for there were plenty of them
5895-34629-0027 which clouds seeing that there was no roof sometimes wept over the masterpiece of ursus
5895-34629-0028 his enthusiasm caused ursus to remark this man and gwynplaine to observe him
5895-34629-0029 they had a great friend in this unknown visitor
5895-34629-0030 one evening ursus was in the side scene which was the kitchen door of the green box seeing master nicless standing by him showed him this man in the crowd and asked him
5895-34629-0031 what a pity that he should not be a lord
5895-34629-0032 he would make a famous scoundrel
5895-34629-0033 at that hour there was no one in the fair ground except perhaps some reeling drunkard making staggering shadows in dark corners
6319-275224-0000 what a fuss is made about you my dear little friends
6319-275224-0001 you surely cannot suppose that in a natural state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall bare stick such as i see you upon now
6319-275224-0002 your cousin the wild convolvulus whom i left in the fields this morning does no such thing i assure you
6319-275224-0003 my young plants require heat or they would not live and the pots we are kept in protect us from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy our roots
6319-275224-0004 why not allow your silver tufts to luxuriate in a natural manner
6319-275224-0005 still the rose tree stood out that there must be some great advantages in a gardener's care for she could not pretend to be ignorant of her own superiority to all her wild relations in the woods
6319-275224-0006 then the wind took another frolic round the garden and made up to the large white lily into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid ugly stick
6319-275224-0007 he really grieved to see it
6319-275224-0008 did that lovely creature suppose that nature who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world had yet left her so weak and feeble that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure
6319-275224-0009 indeed not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions
6319-275224-0010 echoed the flowers tremulously as with a sort of fearful pleasure they awaited his approach
6319-275224-0011 making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the convolvulus pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loosed all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and levelled the sweet peas to the ground
6319-275224-0012 meanwhile how fared it with the flowers
6319-275224-0013 oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fir pole
6319-275224-0014 the honeysuckle escaped no better and the carnation was ready to die of vexation at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled her to the dirt
6319-275224-0015 before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look over his pretty charges
6319-275224-0016 but for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all
6319-275224-0017 weeds meanwhile sprang up and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden
6319-275224-0018 the mistress had returned and the young lady was with her and hurried at once to her favourite garden
6319-275224-0019 in this position she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder
6319-275224-0020 i am not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
174-168635-0000 he had never been father lover husband friend
174-168635-0001 the heart of that ex convict was full of virginity
174-168635-0002 his sister and his sister's children had left him only a vague and far off memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them
174-168635-0003 he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing
174-168635-0004 only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light
174-168635-0005 cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing
174-168635-0006 she felt that which she had never felt before a sensation of expansion
174-168635-0007 the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty
174-168635-0008 nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf
174-168635-0009 to meet was to find each other
174-168635-0010 when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely
174-168635-0011 moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well
174-168635-0012 he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing room as we have seen
174-168635-0013 week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel
174-168635-0014 cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning
174-168635-0015 and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray
174-168635-0016 he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle
174-168635-0017 the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts
174-168635-0018 he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim
174-168635-0019 who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more
174-168635-0020 alas he walked with no less indecision than cosette
174-168635-0021 he protected her and she strengthened him
174-168635-0022 he was that child's stay and she was his prop
251-118436-0000 he was young no spear had touched him no poison lurked in his wine
251-118436-0001 i tell you it is not poison she cried
251-118436-0002 since his birth he has been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisoners of the east could not reach him
251-118436-0003 as you well know there are ten men and ten women whose sole duty is to taste his food and wine and fifty armed warriors guard his chamber as they guard it now
251-118436-0004 a low confused moan waned from his mouth
251-118436-0005 the man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabesque chamber
251-118436-0006 this man was clad in a brown camel hair robe and sandals and a green turban was on his head
251-118436-0007 not until the heavens were in the proper order could they perform this necromancy
251-118436-0008 with a long stained fingernail he mapped the constellations on the marble tiled floor
251-118436-0009 the slant of the moon presaged evil for the king of vendhya the stars are in turmoil the serpent in the house of the elephant
251-118436-0010 point of contact inquired the other
251-118436-0011 all discarded portions of the human body still remain part of it attached to it by intangible connections
251-118436-0012 but at the urgent entreaty of the princess of khosala who loved bhunda chand vainly he gave her a lock of his long black hair as a token of remembrance
251-118436-0013 by which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space returned the man on the mat
251-118436-0014 on the dais under the golden dome the king cried out again racked by awful paroxysms
251-118436-0015 they seek to snap the silver cord that binds me to my dying body
251-118436-0016 they cluster around me their hands are taloned their eyes are red like flame burning in darkness
251-118436-0017 their fingers sear me like fire
251-118436-0018 i know now what brings me to the pyre
251-118436-0019 there they strove to break the silver cord of life and thrust my soul into the body of a foul night weird their sorcery summoned up from hell ah
251-118436-0020 your cry and the grip of your fingers brought me back but i am going fast
251-118436-0021 there was the old imperious note in his failing whisper
251-118436-0022 you have never disobeyed me obey my last command
251-118436-0023 send my soul clean to asura
652-130726-0000 san francisco's care free spirit was fully exemplified before the ashes of the great fire of nineteen o six were cold
652-130726-0001 thompson opened a large restaurant in o'farrell street just above fillmore and for two years or more did a thriving business his place being noted for its good cooking and its splendid service
652-130726-0002 one of his waiters phil tyson was one of the earlier ones to go back into the burned district to begin business and he opened a restaurant called the del monte in powell street near market but it was too early for success and closed after a short career
652-130726-0003 here as well as in a number of other places one can well appreciate the colloquial definition of cabaret
652-130726-0004 here there is always good music and food well cooked and well served and always a lively crowd during the luncheon dinner and after theatre hours the room is not large but its dimensions are greatly magnified owing to the covering of mirrors which line the walls
652-130726-0005 this garish display of mirrors and elaborate decoration of ceiling and pillars gives it the appearance of the abode of saturnalia but decorum is the rule among the patrons
652-130726-0006 john tait is the presiding spirit here he having made reputation as club manager and then as manager of the cliff house
652-130726-0007 the poodle dog has a hotel attachment where one may get rooms or full apartments
652-130726-0008 if you know how to order and do not care to count the cost when you order probably the best dinner at these restaurants can be had at either blanco's or the poodle dog
652-130726-0009 the cuisine is of the best and the chefs rank at the top of their art
652-130726-0010 at the two mentioned one pays for the surroundings as well as for the food and sometimes this is worth paying for
652-130726-0011 the restaurants of the present day that approach nearest the old bohemian restaurants of pre fire days of the french class are jack's in sacramento street between montgomery and kearny felix in montgomery street between clay and washington and the poodle dog bergez franks in bush street between kearny and grant avenue
652-130726-0012 in either of these restaurants you will be served with the best the market affords cooked the right way
652-130726-0013 in this same district is the mint in commercial street between montgomery and kearny streets
652-130726-0014 it has changed from what it was in the old days but is still an excellent place to dine
652-130726-0015 it is an idea that is worth while but unfortunately the proprietors depend too much on the decorative feature and too little on the food and how they serve it
652-130726-0016 the fly trap and charlie's fashion the first in sutter street near kearny and the other in market near sutter serve well cooked foods especially soup salads and fish
652-130726-0017 of course these are not the entire menus but of all the well prepared dishes these are their best
652-130726-0018 both serve good spanish dinners at reasonable prices
652-130726-0019 his prices are moderate and his cooking and viands of the best and will satisfy the most critical of the gourmets
652-130726-0020 at the corner of market and eddy streets is the odeon down in a basement with decorations of most garish order
652-130726-0021 one can almost imagine himself in one of the famous rathskellers of old heidelberg not at the schloss of course for here you cannot look down on the weiser as it flows beneath the windows of the great wine stube on the hill
652-130726-0022 but if you really love good music music that has melody and rhythm and soothing cadences go to the heidelberg inn and listen to the concert which is a feature of the place every evening
652-130726-0023 we finally got him to select the one prized above all others and this is what chef scheiler gave us
652-130726-0024 to the pickle add two large onions cut in quarters two fresh carrots and about one ounce of mixed whole allspice black peppers cloves and bay leaves
652-130726-0025 put in the oven and brown to a golden color
652-130726-0026 then take it out of the roasting pan and put it into a casserole after sprinkling it with two ounces of flour
652-130726-0027 put into the oven again and cook for half an hour basting frequently with the original brine
652-130726-0028 when done take the meat out of the sauce
652-130726-0029 strain the sauce through a fine collander and add a few raisins a piece of honey cake or ginger snaps and the meat of one fresh tomato
652-130726-0030 season with salt and pepper and a little sugar to taste
652-130726-0031 the hof brau however is less distinctively german as the greater number of its patrons are americans
652-130726-0032 the specialty of the hof brau is abalone's and they have as a feature this shell fish cooked in several ways
652-130726-0033 they also have as the chef in charge of the abalone dishes herbert formerly chef for one of the yacht clubs of the coast who claims to have the only proper recipe for making abalone's tender
652-130726-0034 under ordinary circumstances the abalone is tough and unpalatable but after the deft manipulation of herbert they are tender and make a fine dish either fried as chowder or a la newberg
652-130726-0035 in addition to abalone's the hof brau makes a specialty of little oregon crawfish
2035-147960-0000 she was four years older than i to be sure and had seen more of the world but i was a boy and she was a girl and i resented her protecting manner
2035-147960-0001 this change came about from an adventure we had together
2035-147960-0002 one day when i rode over to the shimerdas i found antonia starting off on foot for russian peter's house to borrow a spade ambrosch needed
2035-147960-0003 there had been another black frost the night before and the air was clear and heady as wine
2035-147960-0004 it was on one of these gravel beds that i met my adventure
2035-147960-0005 i whirled round and there on one of those dry gravel beds was the biggest snake i had ever seen
2035-147960-0006 i know i am just awful jim i was so scared
2035-147960-0007 i never know you was so brave jim she went on comfortingly
2035-147960-0008 a faint fetid smell came from him and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head
2035-147960-0009 look tony that's his poison i said
2035-147960-0010 i explained to antonia how this meant that he was twenty four years old that he must have been there when white men first came left on from buffalo and indian times
2035-147960-0011 we decided that antonia should ride dude home and i would walk
2035-147960-0012 i followed with the spade over my shoulder dragging my snake
2035-147960-0013 otto fuchs was the first one we met
2035-147960-0014 he could stand right up and talk to you he could did he fight hard
2035-147960-0015 otto winked at me
2035-147960-0016 a snake of his size in fighting trim would be more than any boy could handle
2277-149874-0000 minnie's flat as the one floor resident apartments were then being called was in a part of west van buren street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks men who had come and were still coming with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of fifty thousand a year
2277-149874-0001 to carrie the sound of the little bells upon the horse cars as they tinkled in and out of hearing was as pleasing as it was novel
2277-149874-0002 to him the presence or absence of his wife's sister was a matter of indifference
2277-149874-0003 he was of a clean saving disposition and had already paid a number of monthly instalments on two lots far out on the west side
2277-149874-0004 his ambition was some day to build a house on them
2277-149874-0005 she had some slight gift of observation and that sense so rich in every woman intuition
2277-149874-0006 the walls of the rooms were discordantly papered
2277-149874-0007 the floors were covered with matting and the hall laid with a thin rag carpet
2277-149874-0008 then she walked and sang to it until hanson disturbed in his reading came and took it
2277-149874-0009 one could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring
2277-149874-0010 now now he said walking there there and there was a certain swedish accent noticeable in his voice
2277-149874-0011 he seemed to be thinking of something else
2277-149874-0012 minnie began to explain but her husband took this part of the conversation to himself
2277-149874-0013 you could get home easy too it isn't very far
2277-149874-0014 she asked minnie for ink and paper which were upon the mantel in the dining room and when the latter had gone to bed at ten got out drouet's card and wrote him
2277-149874-0015 she wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train but was too timid
2277-149874-0016 anything was good enough so long as it paid say five dollars a week to begin with
2277-149874-0017 a shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer
2277-149874-0018 it was under such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning to look for work
2277-149874-0019 narrow board walks extended out passing here a house and there a store at far intervals eventually ending on the open prairie
2277-149874-0020 it gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street
2277-149874-0021 these vast buildings what were they
2412-153947-0000 preface to second edition
2412-153947-0001 this is a mistake though a perfectly natural one
2412-153947-0002 on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer
2412-153947-0003 then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
2412-153947-0004 i regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
2412-153947-0005 i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the book here though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
2412-153947-0006 but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
2412-153947-0007 i must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures
2412-153947-0008 it was written in the upper rangitata district of the canterbury province as it then was of new zealand and appeared at christchurch in the press newspaper june thirteenth eighteen sixty three
2412-153947-0009 i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
2412-153947-0010 i see from my second preface that i took the book to messrs chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two
2412-153947-0011 i attribute its unlooked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the pall mall gazette of april twelfth and the second in the spectator of april twentieth
2412-153947-0012 there was also another cause
2412-153947-0013 the first edition of erewhon sold in about three weeks i had not taken moulds and as the demand was strong it was set up again immediately
2412-153947-0014 i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new editions were from time to time wanted they have been printed from stereos then made
2412-153947-0015 i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of erewhon that were repeatedly rewritten but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could
2412-153947-0016 this however may not be for the copyright will probably expire in a little over twelve years
6295-244435-0000 chapter seven the homecoming
6295-244435-0001 colonel leonidas talbot regarded the white flag with feelings in which triumph and sadness were mingled strangely
6295-244435-0002 but the emotions of harry and his comrades were for the moment those of victory only
6295-244435-0003 boats put out both from the fort and the shore
6295-244435-0004 the smoke itself which had formed a vast cloud over harbor forts and city was now drifting out to sea leaving all things etched sharply in the dazzling sunlight of a southern spring day
6295-244435-0005 that white flag and those boats going out mean that sumter is ours
6295-244435-0006 but the negotiations were soon completed
6295-244435-0007 all the amenities were preserved between the captured garrison and their captors
6295-244435-0008 the great state of virginia mother of presidents went out of the union at last and north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed her but maryland kentucky and missouri still hung in the balance
6295-244435-0009 lincoln had called for volunteers to put down a rebellion but harry heard everywhere in charleston that the confederacy was now secure
6295-244435-0010 the progress of president davis to the new capital set in the very face of the foe was to be one huge triumph of faith and loyalty
6295-244435-0011 there was not a single note of gloom
6295-244435-0012 europe which must have its cotton would favor the success of the south
6295-244435-0013 an extraordinary wave of emotion swept over the south carrying everybody with it
6295-244435-0014 beauregard at once wrote an order
6295-244435-0015 colonel kenton writes wisely
6295-244435-0016 we need kentucky and i understand that a very little more may bring the state to us go with your father i understand that you have been a brave young soldier here and may you do as well up there
6295-244435-0017 harry feeling pride but not showing it saluted and left the room going at once to madame delaunay's where he had left his baggage
6295-244435-0018 he intended to leave early in the morning but first he sought his friends and told them good bye
6295-244435-0019 harry gave his farewells with deep and genuine regret
6295-244435-0020 whether their manner was grave or frivolous he knew that these were good friends of his and he sincerely hoped that he would meet them again
6295-244435-0021 it was a different harry who started home late in april
6295-244435-0022 four months had made great changes he bore himself more like a man his manner was much more considered and grave
6295-244435-0023 he had seen great things and he had done his share of them
6295-244435-0024 he gazed upon a world full of responsibilities and perils
6295-244435-0025 but he looked back at charleston the gay the volatile and the beautiful with real affection
6295-244435-0026 it was almost buried now in flowers and foliage
6295-244435-0027 he was going home after victory
6295-244435-0028 he soon left charleston out of sight
6295-244435-0029 he felt the difference as soon as he reached the hills of his native state
6295-244435-0030 people were cooler here and they were more prone to look at the two sides of a question
6295-244435-0031 the air too was unlike that of south carolina there was a sharper tang to it
6295-244435-0032 it whipped his blood as it blew down from the slopes and crests
6295-244435-0033 it was afternoon when he reached the little station of winton and left the train a tall sturdy boy the superior of many a man in size strength and agility
6295-244435-0034 there were never before such times in old kentucky
6295-244435-0035 bill skelly an his gang them mountaineers are up
6295-244435-0036 he did not say the last as a boast but merely as an assurance to the liveryman who he saw was anxious on his account
6295-244435-0037 if you've got pistols just you think once before you shoot said collins
6295-244435-0038 harry thanked him threw his saddle bags across the horse a powerful bay and giving a final wave of his hand to the sympathetic liveryman rode away
6295-244435-0039 this was not the fashion of a year ago when they exchanged a friendly word or two but harry knew its cause now nobody could trust anybody else
6295-244435-0040 but he saw nothing that moved there no signal lights twinkled
1272-135031-0000 because you were sleeping instead of conquering the lovely rose princess has become a fiddle without a bow while poor shaggy sits there a cooing dove
1272-135031-0001 he has gone and gone for good answered polychrome who had managed to squeeze into the room beside the dragon and had witnessed the occurrences with much interest
1272-135031-0002 i have remained a prisoner only because i wished to be one and with this he stepped forward and burst the stout chains as easily as if they had been threads
1272-135031-0003 the little girl had been asleep but she heard the raps and opened the door
1272-135031-0004 the king has fled in disgrace and your friends are asking for you
1272-135031-0005 i begged ruggedo long ago to send him away but he would not do so
1272-135031-0006 i also offered to help your brother to escape but he would not go
1272-135031-0007 he eats and sleeps very steadily replied the new king
1272-135031-0008 i hope he doesn't work too hard said shaggy
1272-135031-0009 he doesn't work at all
1272-135031-0010 in fact there is nothing he can do in these dominions as well as our nomes whose numbers are so great that it worries us to keep them all busy
1272-135031-0011 not exactly returned kaliko
1272-135031-0012 where is my brother now
1272-135031-0013 inquired shaggy in the metal forest
1272-135031-0014 where is that
1272-135031-0015 the metal forest is in the great domed cavern the largest in all our dominions replied kaliko
1272-135031-0016 kaliko hesitated
1272-135031-0017 however if we look sharp we may be able to discover one of these secret ways
1272-135031-0018 oh no i'm quite sure he didn't
1272-135031-0019 that's funny remarked betsy thoughtfully
1272-135031-0020 i don't believe ann knew any magic or she'd have worked it before
1272-135031-0021 i do not know confessed shaggy
1272-135031-0022 true agreed kaliko
1272-135031-0023 kaliko went to the big gong and pounded on it just as ruggedo used to do but no one answered the summons
1272-135031-0024 having returned to the royal cavern kaliko first pounded the gong and then sat in the throne wearing ruggedo's discarded ruby crown and holding in his hand the sceptre which ruggedo had so often thrown at his head
2086-149220-0000 the enclosure had formerly been very extensive but was now contracted within small compass and hemmed about partly by high wooden fences and partly by the outbuildings of houses that stood on another street
2086-149220-0001 the white double rosebush had evidently been propped up anew against the house since the commencement of the season and a pear tree and three damson trees which except a row of currant bushes constituted the only varieties of fruit bore marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs
2086-149220-0002 there were also a few species of antique and hereditary flowers in no very flourishing condition but scrupulously weeded as if some person either out of love or curiosity had been anxious to bring them to such perfection as they were capable of attaining
2086-149220-0003 summer squashes almost in their golden blossom cucumbers now evincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock and ramble far and wide two or three rows of string beans and as many more that were about to festoon themselves on poles tomatoes occupying a site so sheltered and sunny that the plants were already gigantic and promised an early and abundant harvest
2086-149220-0004 phoebe wondered whose care and toil it could have been that had planted these vegetables and kept the soil so clean and orderly
2086-149220-0005 bees too strange to say had thought it worth their while to come hither possibly from the range of hives beside some farm house miles away
2086-149220-0006 this was a fountain set round with a rim of old mossy stones and paved in its bed with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic work of variously colored pebbles
2086-149220-0007 it now contained only chanticleer his two wives and a solitary chicken
2086-149220-0008 it was evident that the race had degenerated like many a noble race besides in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure
2086-149220-0009 these feathered people had existed too long in their distinct variety a fact of which the present representatives judging by their lugubrious deportment seemed to be aware
2086-149220-0010 they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and hatched a chicken not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls
2086-149220-0011 the distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of lamentably scanty growth in these latter days but so oddly and wickedly analogous to hepzibah's turban that phoebe to the poignant distress of her conscience but inevitably was led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative
2086-149220-0012 the chicken crept through the pales of the coop and ran with some show of liveliness to her feet while chanticleer and the ladies of his household regarded her with queer sidelong glances and then croaked one to another as if communicating their sage opinions of her character
2086-149220-0013 so wise as well as antique was their aspect as to give color to the idea not merely that they were the descendants of a time honored race but that they had existed in their individual capacity ever since the house of the seven gables was founded and were somehow mixed up with its destiny
2086-149220-0014 he held a hoe in his hand and while phoebe was gone in quest of the crumbs had begun to busy himself with drawing up fresh earth about the roots of the tomatoes
2086-149220-0015 they have known me much longer but never honor me with any familiarity though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food
2086-149220-0016 miss hepzibah i suppose will interweave the fact with her other traditions and set it down that the fowls know you to be a pyncheon
2086-149220-0017 ah but these hens answered the young man these hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barn yard fowl
2086-149220-0018 i prefer to think and so would miss hepzibah that they recognize the family tone for you are a pyncheon
2086-149220-0019 my name is phoebe pyncheon said the girl with a manner of some reserve for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than the daguerreotypist of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a disagreeable idea
2086-149220-0020 i turn up the earth by way of pastime
2086-149220-0021 it is like a bandage over one's eyes to come into it
2086-149220-0022 if you would permit me said the artist looking at phoebe i should like to try whether the daguerreotype can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face
2086-149220-0023 most of my likenesses do look unamiable but the very sufficient reason i fancy is because the originals are so
2086-149220-0024 there is a wonderful insight in heaven's broad and simple sunshine
2086-149220-0025 while we give it credit only for depicting the merest surface it actually brings out the secret character with a truth that no painter would ever venture upon even could he detect it
2086-149220-0026 yet the original wears to common eyes a very different expression
2086-149220-0027 he exhibited a daguerreotype miniature in a morocco case
2086-149220-0028 phoebe merely glanced at it and gave it back
2086-149220-0029 i can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet
2086-149220-0030 the sun as you see tells quite another story and will not be coaxed out of it after half a dozen patient attempts on my part
2086-149220-0031 here we have the man sly subtle hard imperious and withal cold as ice look at that eye
2086-149220-0032 and yet if you could only see the benign smile of the original
2086-149220-0033 well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait
2086-149220-0034 if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard
2086-149220-0035 is there nothing wild in the eye continued holgrave so earnestly that it embarrassed phoebe as did also the quiet freedom with which he presumed on their so recent acquaintance
2086-149220-0036 it is nonsense said phoebe a little impatiently for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen
2086-149220-0037 since you are a friend of my cousin hepzibah's you should ask her to show you the picture
2086-149220-0038 so we will be fellow laborers somewhat on the community system
2086-149220-0039 she did not altogether like him
2086-149220-0040 oh rejoined the daguerreotypist because like an old lady's cup of tea it is water bewitched
2086-149220-0041 she was indistinctly aware however that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs a little withdrawn from the window the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek turned sideways towards a corner
2086-149220-0042 but put it on the table in the corner of the passage
2086-149220-0043 what an instrument is the human voice
2086-149220-0044 how wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul
2086-149220-0045 fewer words than before but with the same mysterious music in them
2086-149220-0046 pray go to bed for i am sure you must need rest
2086-149220-0047 i will sit in the parlor awhile and collect my thoughts
2086-149220-0048 while thus dismissing her the maiden lady stept forward kissed phoebe and pressed her to her heart which beat against the girl's bosom with a strong high and tumultuous swell
2086-149220-0049 at some uncertain period in the depths of night and as it were through the thin veil of a dream she was conscious of a footstep mounting the stairs heavily but not with force and decision
84-121550-0000 but with full ravishment the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of leaves that ever bore a burden to their rhymes
84-121550-0001 all waters that on earth most limpid are would seem to have within themselves some mixture compared with that which nothing doth conceal
84-121550-0002 thou makest me remember where and what proserpina that moment was when lost her mother her and she herself the spring
84-121550-0003 i do not think there shone so great a light under the lids of venus when transfixed by her own son beyond his usual custom
84-121550-0004 ye are new comers and because i smile began she peradventure in this place elect to human nature for its nest
84-121550-0005 some apprehension keeps you marvelling but the psalm delectasti giveth light which has the power to uncloud your intellect
84-121550-0006 the good supreme sole in itself delighting created man good and this goodly place gave him as hansel of eternal peace
84-121550-0007 by his default short while he sojourned here by his default to weeping and to toil he changed his innocent laughter and sweet play
84-121550-0008 this every other savour doth transcend and notwithstanding slaked so far may be thy thirst that i reveal to thee no more
84-121550-0009 between her steps and mine were not a hundred when equally the margins gave a turn in such a way that to the east i faced
84-121550-0010 nor even thus our way continued far before the lady wholly turned herself unto me saying brother look and listen
84-121550-0011 now helicon must needs pour forth for me and with her choir urania must assist me to put in verse things difficult to think
84-121550-0012 then back i turned my face to those high things which moved themselves towards us so sedately they had been distanced by new wedded brides
84-121550-0013 and i beheld the flamelets onward go leaving behind themselves the air depicted and they of trailing pennons had the semblance so that it overhead remained distinct with sevenfold lists all of them of the colours whence the sun's bow is made and delia's girdle
84-121550-0014 these standards to the rearward longer were than was my sight and as it seemed to me ten paces were the outermost apart
84-121550-0015 the interval between these four contained a chariot triumphal on two wheels which by a griffin's neck came drawn along
84-121550-0016 not only rome with no such splendid car e'er gladdened africanus or augustus but poor to it that of the sun would be
84-121550-0017 three maidens at the right wheel in a circle came onward dancing one so very red that in the fire she hardly had been noted
84-121550-0018 the second was as if her flesh and bones had all been fashioned out of emerald the third appeared as snow but newly fallen
84-121550-0019 in rear of all the group here treated of two old men i beheld unlike in habit but like in gait each dignified and grave
84-121550-0020 and when the car was opposite to me thunder was heard and all that folk august seemed to have further progress interdicted
84-121550-0021 and one of them as if by heaven commissioned singing veni sponsa de libano shouted three times and all the others after
84-121550-0022 as soon as on my vision smote the power sublime that had already pierced me through ere from my boyhood i had yet come forth
84-121550-0023 to the left hand i turned with that reliance with which the little child runs to his mother when he has fear or when he is afflicted
84-121550-0024 to say unto virgilius not a drachm of blood remains in me that does not tremble i know the traces of the ancient flame
84-121550-0025 dante because virgilius has departed do not weep yet do not weep yet awhile for by another sword thou need'st must weep
84-121550-0026 i saw the lady who erewhile appeared veiled underneath the angelic festival direct her eyes to me across the river
84-121550-0027 look at me well in sooth i'm beatrice
84-121550-0028 ye keep your watch in the eternal day so that nor night nor sleep can steal from you one step the ages make upon their path
84-121550-0029 therefore my answer is with greater care that he may hear me who is weeping yonder so that the sin and dole be of one measure
84-121550-0030 but by the largess of celestial graces which have such lofty vapours for their rain that near to them our sight approaches not
84-121550-0031 as soon as ever of my second age i was upon the threshold and changed life himself from me he took and gave to others
84-121550-0032 so low he fell that all appliances for his salvation were already short save showing him the people of perdition
84-121550-0033 confusion and dismay together mingled forced such a yes from out my mouth that sight was needful to the understanding of it
84-121550-0034 whence she to me in those desires of mine which led thee to the loving of that good beyond which there is nothing to aspire to
84-121550-0035 and what allurements or what vantages upon the forehead of the others showed that thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them
2803-154320-0000 fortunately will halley was not a man in a hurry and did not use a press of canvas or his masts would inevitably have come down
2803-154320-0001 john mangles therefore hoped that the wretched hull would reach port without accident but it grieved him that his companions should have to suffer so much discomfort from the defective arrangements of the brig
2803-154320-0002 their friends did their best to amuse them
2803-154320-0003 their minds were so distracted at this change of route as to be quite unhinged
2803-154320-0004 much as they had been interested in his dissertation on the pampas or australia his lectures on new zealand fell on cold and indifferent ears
2803-154320-0005 his eyes wandered ceaselessly over the blank horizon
2803-154320-0006 what then my lord
2803-154320-0007 god keep us from such a meeting why john
2803-154320-0008 we could not even fly fly john
2803-154320-0009 yes my lord we should try in vain
2803-154320-0010 we would fight to the death of course but after that
2803-154320-0011 think of lady glenarvan think of mary grant
2803-154320-0012 will halley is a brute but i am keeping my eyes open and if the coast looks dangerous i will put the ship's head to sea again
2803-154320-0013 so that on that score there is little or no danger
2803-154320-0014 but as to getting alongside the duncan god forbid
7850-281318-0000 some are wonderfully wrought pretty little homes for birdikins
7850-281318-0001 indeed it is not a nest at all only the beginning of one
7850-281318-0002 and there is an old story about this which i shall tell you
7850-281318-0003 oh what shall we do for a home
7850-281318-0004 and the poor silly things ruffled up their feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is unhappy
7850-281318-0005 she was indeed a clever bird
7850-281318-0006 she popped into her new house and sat there comfortably peering out through the window slits with her sharp little eyes
7850-281318-0007 and she saw the other birds hopping about and twittering helplessly
7850-281318-0008 then all the other birds chirped eagerly yes yes let us ask her to teach us
7850-281318-0009 so in a great company they came fluttering hopping twittering up to the elm tree where mother magpie nestled comfortably in her new house
7850-281318-0010 o wise mother magpie dear mother magpie they cried teach us how to build our nests like yours for it is growing night and we are tired and sleepy
7850-281318-0011 the magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient diligent obedient class of little birds
7850-281318-0012 and where each bird perched there it was to build its nest
7850-281318-0013 she began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into nests as they should be made
7850-281318-0014 and some of the birds who were attentive and careful soon saw how it was done and started nice homes for themselves
7850-281318-0015 i thought that was the way to begin
7850-281318-0016 certainly of course screamed the jackdaw
7850-281318-0017 here wood pigeon said mother magpie you must place those sticks through and across criss cross criss cross so
7850-281318-0018 criss cross criss cross so interrupted the wood pigeon
7850-281318-0019 you say you know all about it then go on and finish your nests by yourselves
7850-281318-0020 much luck may you have
7850-281318-0021 and away she flew to her own cosy nest in the elm tree where she was soon fast asleep forgetting all about the matter
7850-281318-0022 but the wood pigeon was in the worst case of them all
7850-281318-0023 for she had only the foundation laid criss cross as the magpie had shown her
8297-275154-0000 not having heard from captain bennydeck for some little time randal thought it desirable in sydney's interests to make inquiries at his club
8297-275154-0001 the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port with no other explanation than that the cruise was over
8297-275154-0002 this alternative in the captain's plans terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal
8297-275154-0003 randal waited a while in london on the chance that bennydeck might pay him a visit
8297-275154-0004 he is staying at this hotel to try the air of sydenham and he finds that it agrees with him
8297-275154-0005 had her beauty fascinated him
8297-275154-0006 randal wrote to accept the invitation determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to question catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview
8297-275154-0007 after months of separation he received a visit from herbert
8297-275154-0008 you distress me herbert more than words can say
8297-275154-0009 he drank the wine greedily
8297-275154-0010 whatever reviving effect it might otherwise have produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner
8297-275154-0011 he put down the empty glass taking no notice of his brother's question
8297-275154-0012 randal he said you know where sydney is
8297-275154-0013 i will do neither the one nor the other
8297-275154-0014 you don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the room thinking so much of you and so little of herself and then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark
8297-275154-0015 i'm alone do you hear that alone
8297-275154-0016 i haven't courage enough to do it for myself
8297-275154-0017 oh why did i engage that governess
8297-275154-0018 i'm afraid he said
8297-275154-0019 i tried it yesterday it set my brains on fire i'm feeling that glass i took just now
8297-275154-0020 he paused and put his hand to his fevered head
8297-275154-0021 was his mind wandering into some other train of thought
8297-275154-0022 you can't do it
8297-275154-0023 let me hear what it is first
8297-275154-0024 i feel for you herbert he said warmly
8297-275154-0025 she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done
8297-275154-0026 let me rest a little he pleaded if i'm not in the way
8297-275154-0027 he mentioned the name of one of the old servants at mount morven who had attached himself to randal after the breakup of the family
1272-128104-0000 mister quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel
1272-128104-0001 nor is mister quilter's manner less interesting than his matter
1272-128104-0002 he tells us that at this festive season of the year with christmas and roast beef looming before us similes drawn from eating and its results occur most readily to the mind
1272-128104-0003 he has grave doubts whether sir frederick leighton's work is really greek after all and can discover in it but little of rocky ithaca
1272-128104-0004 linnell's pictures are a sort of up guards and at em paintings and mason's exquisite idylls are as national as a jingo poem mister birket foster's landscapes smile at one much in the same way that mister carker used to flash his teeth and mister john collier gives his sitter a cheerful slap on the back before he says like a shampooer in a turkish bath next man
1272-128104-0005 it is obviously unnecessary for us to point out how luminous these criticisms are how delicate in expression
1272-128104-0006 on the general principles of art mister quilter writes with equal lucidity
1272-128104-0007 painting he tells us is of a different quality to mathematics and finish in art is adding more fact
1272-128104-0008 as for etchings they are of two kinds british and foreign
1272-128104-0009 he laments most bitterly the divorce that has been made between decorative art and what we usually call pictures makes the customary appeal to the last judgment and reminds us that in the great days of art michael angelo was the furnishing upholsterer
1272-128104-0010 near the fire and the ornaments fred brought home from india on the mantel board
1272-128104-0011 in fact he is quite severe on mister ruskin for not recognising that a picture should denote the frailty of man and remarks with pleasing courtesy and felicitous grace that many phases of feeling
1272-128104-0012 only unfortunately his own work never does get good
1272-128104-0013 mister quilter has missed his chance for he has failed even to make himself the tupper of painting

6313-76958-0002 not on the range why not demanded the boy
6313-76958-0003 a loud laugh followed at chunky's expense
6313-76958-0004 the pony did most of it admitted the lad i just gave him his head and that's all there was to it
6313-76958-0005 walter had gone out with the second guard and the others had gathered around the camp fire for their nightly story telling
6313-76958-0006 none of you will be fit for duty to morrow

6313-76958-0010 the lads found that a pair of blankets had been assigned to each of them with an ordinary wagon sheet doubled for a tarpaulin
6313-76958-0011 these they spread out on the ground using boots wrapped in coats for pillows
6313-76958-0012 stacy brown proved the only grumbler in the lot declaring that he could not sleep a wink on such a bed as that
6313-76958-0013 the horses of the outfit save those that were on night duty and two or three others that had developed a habit of straying had been turned loose early in the evening for animals on the trail are seldom staked down
6313-76958-0014 in spite of their hard couches the pony riders slept soundly even professor zepplin himself never waking the whole night through
6313-76958-0015 stacy grumbled turned over and went to sleep again
6313-76958-0016 you won't be so fast to wake up hard working cowboys after that i reckon
6313-76958-0017 lumpy bates came running toward him not daring to call out for fear of waking the camp
6313-76958-0018 hi there hissed lumpy filled with indignation that anyone should attempt to mount a pony from the right side
6313-76958-0019 stacy brown's left leg swung over the saddle
6313-76958-0020 where are they asked the boy
6313-76958-0021 keep a going and if you're lucky you'll run plumb into them was the jeering answer as the sleepy cowmen spurred their ponies on toward camp muttering their disapproval of taking along a bunch of boys on a cattle drive
6313-76958-0022 almost before the echoes of his voice had died away a shrill voice piped up from the tail end of the chuck wagon
6313-76958-0023 grub pi le grub pi le

6313-76958-0027 oh no this kind of a wrangler isn't laughed the foreman
6313-76958-0028 he's a trouble curer not a troublemaker except for himself

1673-143397-0001 without any legal sentence without any royal mandate the patriarch at the dawn of day led a seditious multitude to the attack of the synagogues
1673-143397-0002 such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate but in this promiscuous outrage the innocent were confounded with the guilty and alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony
1673-143397-0003 the zeal of cyril exposed him to the penalties of the julian law but in a feeble government and a superstitious age he was secure of impunity and even of praise
1673-143397-0004 orestes complained but his just complaints were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of theodosius and too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to pardon and continued to hate the praefect of egypt

1673-143397-0008 at these blasphemous sounds the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken
1673-143397-0009 but the vatican received with open arms the messengers of egypt
1673-143397-0010 the vanity of celestine was flattered by the appeal and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope who with his latin clergy was ignorant of the language the arts and the theology of the greeks
1673-143397-0011 nestorius who depended on the near approach of his eastern friends persisted like his predecessor chrysostom to disclaim the jurisdiction and to disobey the summons of his enemies they hastened his trial and his accuser presided in the seat of judgment

1673-143397-0016 the feeble son of arcadius was alternately swayed by his wife and sister by the eunuchs and women of the palace superstition and avarice were their ruling passions and the orthodox chiefs were assiduous in their endeavors to alarm the former and to gratify the latter
1673-143397-0017 but in this awful moment of the danger of the church their vow was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable duty
1673-143397-0018 at the same time every avenue of the throne was assaulted with gold
1673-143397-0019 the past he regretted he was discontented with the present and the future he had reason to dread the oriental bishops successively disengaged their cause from his unpopular name and each day decreased the number of the schismatics who revered nestorius as the confessor of the faith
1673-143397-0020 a wandering tribe of the blemmyes or nubians invaded his solitary prison in their retreat they dismissed a crowd of useless captives but no sooner had nestorius reached the banks of the nile than he would gladly have escaped from a roman and orthodox city to the milder servitude of the savages

2412-153948-0000 if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedents nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself
2412-153948-0001 it will be seen that i did not succeed in my design and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange i have been unable to reap any pecuniary advantage
2412-153948-0002 no one who is himself honest will doubt my being so
2412-153948-0003 i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lest the reader should gather in which hemisphere i was
2412-153948-0004 sheep and cattle were introduced and bred with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the other till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep or cattle were spotted about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
2412-153948-0005 i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
2412-153948-0006 i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand nor to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not above eight hundred of them and being all breeding ewes they were pretty quiet
2412-153948-0007 there were a good many sheep which i knew as two or three black ewes and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
2412-153948-0008 it is surprising how soon the eye becomes accustomed to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundred
2412-153948-0009 it was a monotonous life but it was very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one is well
2412-153948-0010 the country was the grandest that can be imagined
2412-153948-0011 so lonely and so solemn with the sad grey clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb bleating upon the mountain side as though its little heart were breaking
2412-153948-0012 each must cry louder and wander farther yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
2412-153948-0013 i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a made man
2412-153948-0014 there was no one in the whole world who had the smallest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was any one at all could i hope to cross it
2412-153948-0015 i would try the nearer range and see how far i could go
1993-147966-0000 the week following christmas brought in a thaw and by new year's day all the world about us was a broth of gray slush and the guttered slope between the windmill and the barn was running black water
1993-147966-0001 it was the first time missus shimerda had been to our house and she ran about examining our carpets and curtains and furniture all the while commenting upon them to her daughter in an envious complaining tone
1993-147966-0002 your mama i said angrily wants other people's things
1993-147966-0003 for ambrosch my mama come here
1993-147966-0004 but you see a body never knows what traits poverty might bring out in em
1993-147966-0005 they began to laugh boisterously when they saw me calling
1993-147966-0006 you've got a birthday present this time jim and no mistake
1462-170138-0000 he had written a number of books himself among them a history of dancing a history of costume a key to shakespeare's sonnets a study of the poetry of ernest dowson et cetera
1462-170138-0001 hugh's written a delightful part for her and she's quite inexpressible
1462-170138-0002 i happen to have mac connell's box for tonight or there'd be no chance of our getting places
1462-170138-0003 alexander exclaimed mildly
1462-170138-0004 myself i always knew she had it in her
1462-170138-0005 do you know alexander mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
1462-170138-0006 when they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of ireland
1462-170138-0007 as they sat down a burst of applause drew alexander's attention to the stage
1462-170138-0008 of course hilda is irish the burgoynes have been stage people for generations and she has the irish voice
1462-170138-0009 it's delightful to hear it in a london theatre
1462-170138-0010 when she began to dance by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night the house broke into a prolonged uproar
1462-170138-0011 after her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of philly's burrow where she sat singing the rising of the moon and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey
1462-170138-0012 mac connell let me introduce mister bartley alexander
1462-170138-0013 the playwright gave mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face
1462-170138-0014 he nodded curtly and made for the door dodging acquaintances as he went
1462-170138-0015 i dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else
1462-170138-0016 he's another who's awfully keen about her let me introduce you
1462-170138-0017 sir harry towne bowed and said that he had met mister alexander and his wife in tokyo
1462-170138-0018 i say sir harry the little girl's going famously to night isn't she
1462-170138-0019 the fact is she's feeling rather seedy poor child
1462-170138-0020 a little attack of nerves possibly
1462-170138-0021 he bowed as the warning bell rang and mainhall whispered you know lord westmere of course the stooped man with the long gray mustache talking to lady dowle
1462-170138-0022 in a moment peggy was on the stage again and alexander applauded vigorously with the rest
1462-170138-0023 in the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously recalling with amusement sir harry's judicial frown
1462-170138-0024 he leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as mainhall himself when at the end of the play she came again and again before the curtain panting a little and flushed her eyes dancing and her eager nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement
1462-170138-0025 all the same he lifted his glass here's to you little hilda
1462-170138-0026 i'm glad she's held her own since
1462-170138-0027 it was youth and poverty and proximity and everything was young and kindly
3081-166546-0000 when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in any way with this case
3081-166546-0001 instantly they absorbed all my attention though i dared not give them a direct look and continued to observe them only in the glass
3081-166546-0002 yes and a very respectable one
3081-166546-0003 the lady is not the mother of the boys but their aunt
3081-166546-0004 the boys belong to the gentleman who is a widower
3081-166546-0005 george nodded
3081-166546-0006 the boys look wide awake enough if the father does not
3081-166546-0007 do they still insist that miss challoner was the only person in the room with them at this time
3081-166546-0008 george
3081-166546-0009 have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide
3081-166546-0010 i know it sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable
3081-166546-0011 the boys look wide awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that
3081-166546-0012 a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing
3081-166546-0013 i inquired of george with my eyes still on this furtive watcher
3081-166546-0014 i took quite a fancy to him why
3081-166546-0015 i am looking at him now
3081-166546-0016 just an everyday detective but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being thorough
3081-166546-0017 yes he's mercurial in all his movements
3081-166546-0018 what does he want
3081-166546-0019 i asked as soon as george had returned to my side
3081-166546-0020 he wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may send me
3081-166546-0021 i emphasised complacently
3081-166546-0022 he appeared to know for he told me at once that he was detective gryce a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these
3081-166546-0023 he gave up work some time ago i have been told my husband went on but evidently a great case still has its allurement for him
3081-166546-0024 the trail here must be a very blind one for them to call him in
3081-166546-0025 i wish we had not left so soon
3081-166546-0026 he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers
3081-166546-0027 however a little later we had a comfortable chat
3081-166546-0028 it was one which gave me a small triumph over george
3081-166546-0029 the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it
3081-166546-0030 their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latter's face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so much reliance had always been placed
3081-166546-0031 this is very good of you he began glancing down at the aged detective's bundled up legs and gently pushing a chair towards him
3081-166546-0032 it's the most inexplicable there
3081-166546-0033 but clews there are absolutely none
3081-166546-0034 that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you can
3081-166546-0035 at least that is what we hope
3081-166546-0036 it's a case in a thousand gryce
3081-166546-0037 the old man's eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor
3081-166546-0038 she had no companion near her
3081-166546-0039 no word no cry just a collapse and sudden fall
3081-166546-0040 in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heaven
3081-166546-0041 what do you make of it gryce
3081-166546-0042 i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell
3081-166546-0043 a young fellow who had been hovering in the background at once stepped forward
3081-166546-0044 he was the plain faced detective who had spoken to george
3081-166546-0045 this sweetwater as they called him was i have since understood one of his proteges and more or less of a favourite
3081-166546-0046 been over the ground studied the affair carefully
3081-166546-0047 very well then you're in a position to pioneer me
3081-166546-0048 well well that's honest at all events
3081-166546-0049 but i'm in no position to make promises
3081-166546-0050 old days don't return for the asking
3081-166546-0051 whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below
3081-166546-0052 one or two of the musicians from the end of the hall
3081-166546-0053 naturally they reached her first
3081-166546-0054 mark sowerby and claus hennerberg
3081-166546-0055 honest germans men who have played here for years
3081-166546-0056 who came next on the scene some people from the lobby
3081-166546-0057 anybody before the father came in
3081-166546-0058 yes miss clarke the middle aged lady with the parrishes
3081-166546-0059 i suppose she has been carefully questioned very i should say
3081-166546-0060 and she speaks of no weapon
3081-166546-0061 not till the doctor came her doctor who was happily in his office in this very building
3081-166546-0062 yes mister slater the assistant manager who was in the lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed
3081-166546-0063 no doubt
3081-166546-0064 sweetwater someone drew that weapon out
3081-166546-0065 not altogether by me
3081-166546-0066 wherever she pleases only i can't walk far
3081-166546-0067 it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place
3081-166546-0068 but they'll put a man on for you
3081-166546-0069 very good manage it as you will
3081-166546-0070 i'll wait here till you're ready explain yourself to the lady tell her i'm an old and rheumatic invalid who has been used to asking his own questions
3081-166546-0071 as her quiet figure appeared in the doorway sweetwater stole a glance at mister gryce
3081-166546-0072 there was no doubting them in this instance
3081-166546-0073 yes
3081-166546-0074 for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musicians gallery
3081-166546-0075 yes many times
3081-166546-0076 what made the difference
3081-166546-0077 miss clarke started and her sweet face showed a moment's perplexity did i she queried musingly
3081-166546-0078 no a very natural one i should say
3081-166546-0079 and the glance she cast him while not meeting his eye showed that she understood the importance of the admission
3081-166546-0080 i know she said what you are going to ask me now
3081-166546-0081 there was no poniard in the wound
3081-166546-0082 the time is narrowed down to one and in that one miss clarke was the only person to touch her
3081-166546-0083 i will trouble you no further
3081-166546-0084 sweetwater help me out of this
3081-166546-0085 but vigour returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clarke and turned to take the elevator
3081-166546-0086 the next minute she was in this lady's arms
3081-166546-0087 no weapon protruded from the wound nor was any found on or near her in the mezzanine what follows
3081-166546-0088 she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her
3081-166546-0089 it did not fall upon the floor around her therefore it flew through one of those openings into the lobby and there it either will be or has been found
5338-284437-0000 it had no ornamentation being exceedingly plain in appearance
5338-284437-0001 here said one of their guides as the procession halted before the little stone building is the palace of tourmaline who is our queen
5338-284437-0002 what that little cabin
5338-284437-0003 exclaimed trot of course
5338-284437-0004 did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences asked the woman evidently surprised
5338-284437-0005 these intruders are very peculiar people remarked a man in the crowd
5338-284437-0006 they seem very ignorant poor things said another in reply
5338-284437-0007 the people must wait outside for there is no room for them in the palace
5338-284437-0008 so they followed her through the low archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of pink stockings
5338-284437-0009 she was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty
5338-284437-0010 her complexion was not a decided pink but a soft rosy tint not much deeper than that of trot's skin
5338-284437-0011 what is it coralie she asked the woman
5338-284437-0012 the queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest
5338-284437-0013 she smiled a little sadly at trot seemed to approve button bright's open frank face and was quite surprised because cap'n bill was so much bigger than her own people
5338-284437-0014 are you a giant
5338-284437-0015 perhaps you are trying to ridicule me she continued regarding the sailor's face closely
5338-284437-0016 there is nothing majestic about me as you know very well
5338-284437-0017 coralie do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing a queen
5338-284437-0018 even in america ever'body bows low to our president an the blueskins are so fraid o their boolooroo that they tremble whenever they go near him
5338-284437-0019 but surely that is all wrong said tourmaline gravely
5338-284437-0020 therefore i am a mere agent to direct the laws which are the will of the people and am only a public servant obliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects
5338-284437-0021 in that case said button bright you're entitled to the best there is to pay for your trouble
5338-284437-0022 if i lived as luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns the good pinkies would say that their queen had more than they themselves and it would be true
5338-284437-0023 no our way is best
5338-284437-0024 the queen has nothing but the power to execute the laws to adjust grievances and to compel order
5338-284437-0025 i have one great privilege
5338-284437-0026 after my death a pink marble statue of me will be set up in the grand court with the statues of the other kings and queens who have ruled this land and all the pinkies in ages to come will then honor me as having been a just and upright queen that is my reward
5338-284437-0027 a misfortune of birth placed me here and i cannot escape my fate
5338-284437-0028 it is much more desirable to be a private citizen happy and care free
5338-284437-0029 yes it was wet an sticky all right agreed the sailor but the big frog helped us an we got through all right
5338-284437-0030 you are not like my people the pinkies and there is no place for you in our country
5338-284437-0031 in all our history you are the first people from outside our borders who have ever stepped a foot in our land
5338-284437-0032 we do not hate you as you say the blueskins do nor are we savage or cruel but we do not want you here and i am really puzzled what to do with you
5338-284437-0033 i'll look in the great book first
1988-24833-0000 the two stray kittens gradually make themselves at home
1988-24833-0001 somehow or other cat has taught them that he's in charge here and he just chases them for fun now and again when he's not busy sleeping
1988-24833-0002 she doesn't pick them up but just having them in the room sure doesn't give her asthma
1988-24833-0003 when are you getting rid of these cats i'm not fixing to start an annex to kate's cat home
1988-24833-0004 right away when i bring home my new program he says how come you're taking one less course this half
1988-24833-0005 i explain that i'm taking music and also biology algebra english and french music he snorts
1988-24833-0006 pop it's a course
1988-24833-0007 he does and for once i win a round i keep music for this semester
1988-24833-0008 i'll be lucky if i have time to breathe
1988-24833-0009 sometimes schools do let kids take a lot of soft courses and then they're out on a limb later huh
1988-24833-0010 so he cares huh
1988-24833-0011 besides says tom half the reason you and your father are always bickering is that you're so much alike me like him sure
1988-24833-0012 as long as there's a bone on the floor the two of you worry it
1988-24833-0013 i get the pillows comfortably arranged on the floor with a big bottle of soda and a bag of popcorn within easy reach
1988-24833-0014 pop goes right on tuning his channel
1988-24833-0015 you're getting altogether too upset about these programs stop it and behave yourself
1988-24833-0016 it's your fault mop it up yourself
1988-24833-0017 i hear the t v going for a few minutes then pop turns it off and goes in the kitchen to talk to mom
1988-24833-0018 well i don't think you should turn a guy's t v program off in the middle without even finding out about it
1988-24833-0019 i look at my watch it's a quarter to eleven
1988-24833-0020 i turn off the television set i've lost track of what's happening and it doesn't seem to be the grandfather who's the spook after all
1988-24833-0021 it's the first time hilda has been to our house and tom introduces her around
1988-24833-0022 i told tom we shouldn't come so late says hilda
1988-24833-0023 tom says thanks and looks at hilda and she blushes really
1988-24833-0024 tom drinks a little more coffee and then he goes on the trouble is i can't get married on this flower shop job
1988-24833-0025 you know i'd get drafted in a year or two anyway
1988-24833-0026 i've decided to enlist in the army
1988-24833-0027 i'll have to check some more says tom
1988-24833-0028 here's to you a long happy life
2803-161169-0000 once there was a father who thought he would build for his children a beautiful home putting into it every thing they could need or desire throughout their lives
2803-161169-0001 the sweetest perfumes floated through the air while thousands of birds answered the music of fountains with their songs
2803-161169-0002 why did he give that so odd a shape or so strange a covering
2803-161169-0003 and so through many questions and many experiments they learn at last how to use the contents of this one storehouse
2803-161169-0004 the entrance is light because it opens so wide but we can see that the floor slopes downward and the way looks dark and narrow before us
2803-161169-0005 walk down the sloping foot path now and be careful to keep out of the way of the little cars that are coming and going on each side of you loaded on one side and empty on the other and seeming to run up and down by themselves
2803-161169-0006 look a little closer while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the black wall at your side
2803-161169-0007 see beneath your feet is the marking of great tree trunks lying aslant across the floor and the forms of gigantic palm leaves strewed among them
2803-161169-0008 here is something different rounded like a nut shell you can split off one side and behold there is the nut lying snugly as does any chestnut in its bur
2803-161169-0009 ferns and palms mosses and trees and animals all perfect all beautiful and yet all hidden away under this hill and turned into shining black coal now i can very well remember when i first saw a coal fire and how odd it looked to see what seemed to be burning stones
2803-161169-0010 for when i was a little girl we always had logs of wood blazing in an open fireplace and so did many other people and coal was just coming into use for fuel
2803-161169-0011 what should we have done if everybody had kept on burning wood to this day
2803-161169-0012 these forests were of trees different in some ways from those we have now great ferns as tall as this house and mosses as high as little trees and palm leaves of enormous size
2803-161169-0013 then the hills were piled up on top of it all but here and there some edge of a coal bed was tilted up and appeared above the ground
2803-161169-0014 but by and by the wise men thought about it and said to themselves we must find out what useful purpose god made the gas for we know that he does not make any thing for harm only
2803-161169-0015 it was only a trouble to the gas makers who had no use for it and even threw it away until some one more thoughtful than the others found out that water would not pass through it
2803-161169-0016 don't you see how many uses we have found for this refuse coal tar
2803-161169-0017 when your hands or lips are cracked and rough from the cold does your mother ever put on glycerin to heal them
2277-149896-0000 he was in a fevered state of mind owing to the blight his wife's action threatened to cast upon his entire future
2277-149896-0001 he would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble it did not matter what he did
2277-149896-0002 hurstwood walked the floor mentally arranging the chief points of his situation
2277-149896-0003 he also thought of his managerial position
2277-149896-0004 how would the papers talk about it
2277-149896-0005 many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brow moistened
2277-149896-0006 he could arrange that satisfactorily for carrie would be glad to wait if necessary
2277-149896-0007 he would see how things turned out to morrow and then he would talk to her they were going to meet as usual
2277-149896-0008 for some reason he felt as if something might come that way and was relieved when all the envelopes had been scanned and nothing suspicious noticed
2277-149896-0009 while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialised and with him no news was good news
2277-149896-0010 so little did he consider drouet that it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out
2277-149896-0011 he grew restless as he ruminated and then decided that perhaps it was nothing
2277-149896-0012 she had not been able to get away this morning
2277-149896-0013 he would get one to day it would probably be on his desk when he got back he would look for it at once
2277-149896-0014 after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the madison car
2277-149896-0015 he went in and examined his letters but there was nothing from carrie
2277-149896-0016 fortunately there was nothing from his wife either
2277-149896-0017 at one thirty he went to rector's for lunch and when he returned a messenger was waiting for him
2277-149896-0018 his first impulse was to write but four words in reply go to the devil
2277-149896-0019 but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply
2277-149896-0020 then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
2277-149896-0021 what would she do about that the confounded wretch
2277-149896-0022 later however his old discretion asserted itself
2277-149896-0023 something had to be done a climax was near and she would not sit idle
2277-149896-0024 he knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up
2277-149896-0025 he arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street
2277-149896-0026 the long drizzle had begun pedestrians had turned up collars and trousers at the bottom
2277-149896-0027 hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistency of this thing
2277-149896-0028 he put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella
2277-149896-0029 he would have some arrangement of this thing
2277-149896-0030 he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other that he had sent the money perhaps he could do it up here
2277-149896-0031 he would go in and see anyhow he would have no row
2277-149896-0032 by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself that he could see his way out
2277-149896-0033 then he rang the bell no answer
2277-149896-0034 he rang again this time harder still no answer
5536-43363-0000 reincarnation and the converse of spirits
5536-43363-0001 therefore he courts death in battle on the other hand he would regard it as disgraceful to be killed in a private quarrel
5536-43363-0002 the men blacken their faces and widows or bereaved parents sometimes gash their arms and legs till they are covered with blood
5536-43363-0003 giving themselves up wholly to their grief they are no longer concerned about any earthly possession and often give away all that they have to the first comers even to their beds and their home
5536-43363-0004 it was prepared by dressing in the finest clothes together with some personal possessions and ornaments wrapped in several robes and finally in a secure covering of raw hide
5536-43363-0005 as a special mark of respect the body of a young woman or a warrior was sometimes laid out in state in a new teepee with the usual household articles and even with a dish of food left beside it not that they supposed the spirit could use the implements or eat the food but merely as a last tribute
5536-43363-0006 if a man were slain in battle it was an old custom to place his body against a tree or rock in a sitting position always facing the enemy to indicate his undaunted defiance and bravery even in death
5536-43363-0007 at every meal time a dish of food was placed under it and some person of the same sex and age as the one who was gone must afterward be invited in to partake of the food
5536-43363-0008 at the end of a year from the time of death the relatives made a public feast and gave away the clothing and other gifts while the lock of hair was interred with appropriate ceremonies
5536-43363-0009 it is well known that the american indian had somehow developed occult power and although in the latter days there have been many impostors and allowing for the vanity and weakness of human nature it is fair to assume that there must have been some even in the old days yet there are well attested instances of remarkable prophecies and other mystic practice
5536-43363-0010 no doubt many predictions have been colored to suit the new age and unquestionably false prophets fakirs and conjurers have become the pest of the tribes during the transition period
5536-43363-0011 this was carried out to the letter
5536-43363-0012 this was only one of his remarkable prophecies
5536-43363-0013 another famous medicine man was born on the rum river about one hundred and fifty years ago and lived to be over a century old
5536-43363-0014 at the age of about seventy five years he saved his band from utter destruction at the hands of their ancestral enemies by suddenly giving warning received in a dream of the approach of a large war party
5536-43363-0015 five years later he repeated the service and again saved his people from awful slaughter
5536-43363-0016 there are many trustworthy men and men of christian faith to vouch for these and similar events occurring as foretold
5536-43363-0017 at another time when i was fourteen years old we had just left fort ellis on the assiniboine river and my youngest uncle had selected a fine spot for our night camp
5536-43363-0018 many of the indians believed that one may be born more than once and there were some who claimed to have full knowledge of a former incarnation
5536-43363-0019 there was a well known sioux war prophet who lived in the middle of the last century so that he is still remembered by the old men of his band
1988-148538-0000 in aristocratic communities the people readily give themselves up to bursts of tumultuous and boisterous gayety which shake off at once the recollection of their privations the natives of democracies are not fond of being thus violently broken in upon and they never lose sight of their own selves without regret
1988-148538-0001 an american instead of going in a leisure hour to dance merrily at some place of public resort as the fellows of his calling continue to do throughout the greater part of europe shuts himself up at home to drink
1988-148538-0002 i believe the seriousness of the americans arises partly from their pride
1988-148538-0003 this is more especially the case amongst those free nations which form democratic communities
1988-148538-0004 then there are in all classes a very large number of men constantly occupied with the serious affairs of the government and those whose thoughts are not engaged in the direction of the commonwealth are wholly engrossed by the acquisition of a private fortune
1988-148538-0005 i do not believe in such republics any more than in that of plato or if the things we read of really happened i do not hesitate to affirm that these supposed democracies were composed of very different elements from ours and that they had nothing in common with the latter except their name
1988-148538-0006 in aristocracies every man has one sole object which he unceasingly pursues but amongst democratic nations the existence of man is more complex the same mind will almost always embrace several objects at the same time and these objects are frequently wholly foreign to each other as it cannot know them all well the mind is readily satisfied with imperfect notions of each
1988-148538-0007 chapter sixteen why the national vanity of the americans is more restless and captious than that of the english
1988-148538-0008 the americans in their intercourse with strangers appear impatient of the smallest censure and insatiable of praise
1988-148538-0009 if i say to an american that the country he lives in is a fine one ay he replies there is not its fellow in the world
1988-148538-0010 if i applaud the freedom which its inhabitants enjoy he answers freedom is a fine thing but few nations are worthy to enjoy it
1988-148538-0011 in aristocratic countries the great possess immense privileges upon which their pride rests without seeking to rely upon the lesser advantages which accrue to them
1988-148538-0012 they therefore entertain a calm sense of their superiority they do not dream of vaunting privileges which everyone perceives and no one contests and these things are not sufficiently new to them to be made topics of conversation
1988-148538-0013 they stand unmoved in their solitary greatness well assured that they are seen of all the world without any effort to show themselves off and that no one will attempt to drive them from that position
1988-148538-0014 when an aristocracy carries on the public affairs its national pride naturally assumes this reserved indifferent and haughty form which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation
1988-148538-0015 these persons then displayed towards each other precisely the same puerile jealousies which animate the men of democracies the same eagerness to snatch the smallest advantages which their equals contested and the same desire to parade ostentatiously those of which they were in possession
8297-275155-0000 on the next day but one randal arranged his departure for sydenham so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner
8297-275155-0001 the new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published randal bought it
8297-275155-0002 after reading one or two of the political articles he arrived at the columns specially devoted to fashionable intelligence
8297-275155-0003 randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph
8297-275155-0004 with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger
8297-275155-0005 missus norman and her little daughter were out driving with a friend and were expected to return in good time for dinner
8297-275155-0006 missus presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel
8297-275155-0007 how nice of you to come so soon she began
8297-275155-0008 she added looking at him suspiciously
8297-275155-0009 but you ought to have known that we are only half an hour behind you at sydenham in the matter of news
8297-275155-0010 the report is premature my good friend
8297-275155-0011 but if these newspaper people waited to find out whether a report is true or false how much gossip would society get in its favorite newspapers
8297-275155-0012 you are to understand that catherine is a widow
8297-275155-0013 sit down said missus presty
8297-275155-0014 you shall hear how my divorced daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandyseal after you left us
8297-275155-0015 you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her
8297-275155-0016 he was introduced to missus norman and to missus norman's little girl and we were all charmed with him
8297-275155-0017 when he and i happened to be left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be
8297-275155-0018 and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that missus norman was a widow
8297-275155-0019 worse stories have been printed i do assure you worse stories have been printed
8297-275155-0020 before i consented to answer the child's inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother
8297-275155-0021 honestly
8297-275155-0022 after that i had her mother's authority for telling kitty that she would never see her father again
8297-275155-0023 she asked directly if her father was dead
8297-275155-0024 that will do missus presty your defense is thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects
8297-275155-0025 randal passed this over without notice
8297-275155-0026 a very wise decision she remarked
8297-275155-0027 have you any message for captain bennydeck
8297-275155-0028 not at the hotel just now
8297-275155-0029 it was a relief to randal in the present state of catherine's relations toward bennydeck to return to london without having seen his friend
8297-275155-0030 good by dear randal
8297-275155-0031 arrived at the station randal found that he must wait for the train
8297-275155-0032 while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about sydney the train from london came in
1988-147956-0000 fuchs brought up a sack of potatoes and a piece of cured pork from the cellar and grandmother packed some loaves of saturday's bread a jar of butter and several pumpkin pies in the straw of the wagon box
1988-147956-0001 occasionally one of the horses would tear off with his teeth a plant full of blossoms and walk along munching it the flowers nodding in time to his bites as he ate down toward them
1988-147956-0002 it's no better than a badger hole no proper dugout at all
1988-147956-0003 now why is that otto
1988-147956-0004 presently against one of those banks i saw a sort of shed thatched with the same wine colored grass that grew everywhere
1988-147956-0005 very glad very glad she ejaculated
1988-147956-0006 you'll get fixed up comfortable after while missus shimerda make good house
1988-147956-0007 my grandmother always spoke in a very loud tone to foreigners as if they were deaf
1988-147956-0008 she made missus shimerda understand the friendly intention of our visit and the bohemian woman handled the loaves of bread and even smelled them and examined the pies with lively curiosity exclaiming much good much thank
1988-147956-0009 the family had been living on corncakes and sorghum molasses for three days
1988-147956-0010 i remembered what the conductor had said about her eyes
1988-147956-0011 her skin was brown too and in her cheeks she had a glow of rich dark color
1988-147956-0012 even from a distance one could see that there was something strange about this boy
1988-147956-0013 he was born like that the others are smart
1988-147956-0014 ambrosch he make good farmer
1988-147956-0015 he struck ambrosch on the back and the boy smiled knowingly
1988-147956-0016 at that moment the father came out of the hole in the bank
1988-147956-0017 it was so long that it bushed out behind his ears and made him look like the old portraits i remembered in virginia
1988-147956-0018 i noticed how white and well shaped his own hands were
1988-147956-0019 we stood panting on the edge of the ravine looking down at the trees and bushes that grew below us
1988-147956-0020 the wind was so strong that i had to hold my hat on and the girls skirts were blown out before them
1988-147956-0021 she looked at me her eyes fairly blazing with things she could not say
1988-147956-0022 she pointed into the gold cottonwood tree behind whose top we stood and said again what name
1988-147956-0023 antonia pointed up to the sky and questioned me with her glance
1988-147956-0024 she got up on her knees and wrung her hands
1988-147956-0025 she was quick and very eager
1988-147956-0026 we were so deep in the grass that we could see nothing but the blue sky over us and the gold tree in front of us
1988-147956-0027 after antonia had said the new words over and over she wanted to give me a little chased silver ring she wore on her middle finger
1988-147956-0028 when i came up he touched my shoulder and looked searchingly down into my face for several seconds
1988-147956-0029 i became somewhat embarrassed for i was used to being taken for granted by my elders
6241-61946-0000 i began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling a life of desire gratification and liberty
6241-61946-0001 hans our extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid unvarying step
6241-61946-0002 our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur
6241-61946-0003 geographers have divided it into four parts and we had to cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called sudvestr fjordungr
6241-61946-0004 we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green
6241-61946-0005 they very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow
6241-61946-0006 i could not help smiling to see him look so big on his little horse his long legs now and then touching the ground made him look like a six footed centaur
6241-61946-0007 snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergs nothing stops him
6241-61946-0008 we may do so was my reply but what about our worthy guide
6241-61946-0009 i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise
6241-61946-0010 my arms are right but my legs are getting a little stiff
6241-61946-0011 here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary bur or icelandic house built of wood earth fragments of lava looking like beggars on the highway of life
6241-61946-0012 a few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally
6241-61946-0013 little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of sneffels where agglomerations of nature's ruins form a kind of terrible chaos
6241-61946-0014 it consists simply of a few houses not what in england or germany we should call a hamlet
6241-61946-0015 i took occasion to consult the map to see where gardar was to be found
6241-61946-0016 these sacred edifices are however very much like these people who do without watches and never miss them
6241-61946-0017 to ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd
6241-61946-0018 in any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs
6241-61946-0019 but my uncle was in no humor to wait
6241-61946-0020 at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professor's legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of rhodes
6241-61946-0021 he says tide replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information
6241-61946-0022 i thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the fjord for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water
6241-61946-0023 accustomed as i had been to the steam ferry boats of the elbe i found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion
174-84280-0000 how we must simplify
174-84280-0001 it seems to me more and more as i live longer that most poetry and most literature and particularly the literature of the past is discordant with the vastness and variety the reserves and resources and recuperations of life as we live it to day
174-84280-0002 it is the expression of life under cruder and more rigid conditions than ours lived by people who loved and hated more naively aged sooner and died younger than we do
174-84280-0003 we range wider last longer and escape more and more from intensity towards understanding
174-84280-0004 and already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events as a thing strange and terrible indeed but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood
174-84280-0005 for a time the death of mary obscured her life for me but now her living presence is more in my mind again
174-84280-0006 it was that idea of waste that dominated my mind in a strange interview i had with justin
174-84280-0007 i became grotesquely anxious to assure him that indeed she and i had been as they say innocent throughout our last day together
174-84280-0008 you were wrong in all that i said she kept her faith with you
174-84280-0009 we never planned to meet and when we met
174-84280-0010 if we had been brother and sister indeed there was nothing
174-84280-0011 but now it doesn't seem to matter very much
174-84280-0012 and it is upon this effect of sweet and beautiful possibilities caught in the net of animal jealousies and thoughtless motives and ancient rigid institutions that i would end this writing
174-84280-0013 in mary it seems to me i found both womanhood and fellowship i found what many have dreamt of love and friendship freely given and i could do nothing but clutch at her to make her my possession
174-84280-0014 what alternative was there for her
174-84280-0015 she was destroyed not merely by the unconsidered undisciplined passions of her husband and her lover but by the vast tradition that sustains and enforces the subjugation of her sex

1272-141231-0000 a man said to the universe sir i exist
1272-141231-0001 sweat covered brion's body trickling into the tight loincloth that was the only garment he wore
1272-141231-0002 the cut on his chest still dripping blood the ache of his overstrained eyes even the soaring arena around him with the thousands of spectators were trivialities not worth thinking about
1272-141231-0003 his instant of panic was followed by a small sharp blow high on his chest
1272-141231-0004 one minute a voice said and the time buzzer sounded
1272-141231-0005 a minute is not a very large measure of time and his body needed every fraction of it
1272-141231-0006 the buzzer's whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation
1272-141231-0007 only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong measured rate
1272-141231-0008 he was in reverie sliding along the borders of consciousness
1272-141231-0009 the contestants in the twenties needed undisturbed rest therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death
1272-141231-0010 particularly so on this last night when only two of the little cubicles were occupied the thousands of others standing with dark empty doors
1272-141231-0011 the other voice snapped with a harsh urgency clearly used to command
1272-141231-0012 i'm here because the matter is of utmost importance and brandd is the one i must see now stand aside
1272-141231-0013 the twenties
1272-141231-0014 he must have drawn his gun because the intruder said quickly put that away you're being a fool out
1272-141231-0015 there was silence then and still wondering brion was once more asleep
1272-141231-0016 ten seconds
1272-141231-0017 he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles
1272-141231-0018 a red haired mountain of a man with an apparently inexhaustible store of energy
1272-141231-0019 there could be little art in this last and final round of fencing
1272-141231-0020 just thrust and parry and victory to the stronger
1272-141231-0021 every man who entered the twenties had his own training tricks
1272-141231-0022 there appeared to be an immediate association with the death trauma as if the two were inextricably linked into one
1272-141231-0023 the strength that enables someone in a trance to hold his body stiff and unsupported except at two points the head and heels
1272-141231-0024 this is physically impossible when conscious
1272-141231-0025 others had died before during the twenties and death during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat
1272-141231-0026 breathing deeply brion softly spoke the auto hypnotic phrases that triggered the process
1272-141231-0027 when the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his second's startled grasp and ran forward
1272-141231-0028 irolg looked amazed at the sudden fury of the attack then smiled
1272-141231-0029 he thought it was a last burst of energy he knew how close they both were to exhaustion
1272-141231-0030 brion saw something close to panic on his opponent's face when the man finally recognized his error
1272-141231-0031 a wave of despair rolled out from irolg brion sensed it and knew the fifth point was his
1272-141231-0032 then the powerful twist that thrust it aside in and under the guard
251-136532-0000 they also found a martian calendar the year had been divided into ten more or less equal months and one of them had been doma
251-136532-0001 bill chandler the zoologist had been going deeper and deeper into the old sea bottom of syrtis
251-136532-0002 that took the center of interest away from archaeology and started a new burst of activity
251-136532-0003 the civilian specialists in other fields and the space force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras were all flying to lower syrtis to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported
251-136532-0004 they had four or five species of what might loosely be called birds and something that could easily be classed as a reptile and a carnivorous mammal the size of a cat with birdlike claws and a herbivore almost identical with the piglike thing in the big darfhulva mural and another like a gazelle with a single horn in the middle of its forehead
251-136532-0005 the daily newscasts from terra showed a corresponding shift in interest at home
251-136532-0006 tony's found the martians
251-136532-0007 it was locked from the inside and we had to burn it down with a torch that's where they are
251-136532-0008 gloria standish who had dropped in for lunch was on the mezzanine fairly screaming into a radiophone extension dozen and a half of them
251-136532-0009 well of course they're dead what a question
251-136532-0010 martha remembered the closed door on the first survey they hadn't attempted opening it
251-136532-0011 now it was burned away at both sides and lay still hot along the edges on the floor of the big office room in front
251-136532-0012 a floodlight was on in the room inside and lattimer was going around looking at things while a space force officer stood by the door
251-136532-0013 mass suicide that's what it was notice what's in the corners
251-136532-0014 yes charcoal
251-136532-0015 so they just came in here and lit the charcoal and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep
251-136532-0016 the terran public wanted to hear about martians and if live martians couldn't be found a room full of dead ones was the next best thing
251-136532-0017 tony lattimer the discoverer was beginning to cash in on his attentions to gloria and his ingratiation with sid he was always either making voice and image talks for telecast or listening to the news from the home planet
251-136532-0018 without question he had become overnight the most widely known archaeologist in history
251-136532-0019 not that i'm interested in all this for myself he disclaimed after listening to the telecast from terra two days after his discovery
251-136532-0020 bring it to the public attention dramatize it
251-136532-0021 so i believe i shall go back at least for a while and see what i can do
251-136532-0022 lectures
251-136532-0023 the organization of a society of martian archaeology with anthony lattimer ph d the logical candidate for the chair
2902-9006-0000 one who writes of such an era labours under a troublesome disadvantage
2902-9006-0001 in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words the sins of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the church's case far more weakly than the facts deserve
2902-9006-0002 not be it ever remembered that the slightest suspicion of immorality attaches either to the heroine of this book or to the leading philosophers of her school for several centuries
2902-9006-0003 that divine word who is the light who lighteth every man which cometh into the world had awakened in the heart of mankind a moral craving never before felt in any strength except by a few isolated philosophers or prophets
2902-9006-0004 the very emperors had arrayed themselves on her side
2902-9006-0005 julian's last attempt to restore paganism by imperial influence had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold upon the hearts of the masses at his death the great tide wave of new opinion rolled on unchecked and the rulers of earth were fain to swim with the stream to accept in words at least the church's laws as theirs to acknowledge a king of kings to whom even they owed homage and obedience and to call their own slaves their poorer brethren and often too their spiritual superiors
2902-9006-0006 but if the emperors had become christian the empire had not
2902-9006-0007 in the meanwhile the minds of men cut adrift from their ancient moorings wandered wildly over pathless seas of speculative doubt and especially in the more metaphysical and contemplative east attempted to solve for themselves the questions of man's relation to the unseen by those thousand schisms heresies and theosophies it is a disgrace to the word philosophy to call them by it on the records of which the student now gazes bewildered unable alike to count or to explain their fantasies
2902-9006-0008 they brought before the minds of churchmen a thousand new questions which must be solved unless the church was to relinquish for ever her claims as the great teacher and satisfier of the human soul
2902-9006-0009 but the health of a church depends not merely on the creed which it professes not even on the wisdom and holiness of a few great ecclesiastics but on the faith and virtue of its individual members
2902-9006-0010 the mens sana must have a corpus sanum to inhabit
2902-9006-0011 and the new blood at the era of this story was at hand
2902-9006-0012 tribe after tribe was crowding down to the alps and trampling upon each other on the frontiers of the empire
2902-9006-0013 the huns singly their inferiors pressed them from behind with the irresistible weight of numbers italy with her rich cities and fertile lowlands beckoned them on to plunder as auxiliaries they had learned their own strength and roman weakness a casus belli was soon found
2902-9006-0014 how iniquitous was the conduct of the sons of theodosius in refusing the usual bounty by which the goths were bribed not to attack the empire the whole pent up deluge burst over the plains of italy and the western empire became from that day forth a dying idiot while the new invaders divided europe among themselves
2902-9006-0015 the countless treasures which five centuries of rapine had accumulated round the capitol had become the prey of men clothed in sheepskins and horse hide and the sister of an emperor had found her beauty virtue and pride of race worthily matched by those of the hard handed northern hero who led her away from italy as his captive and his bride to found new kingdoms in south france and spain and to drive the newly arrived vandals across the straits of gibraltar into the then blooming coast land of northern africa
2902-9006-0016 that extraordinary reform in morals which according to salvian and his contemporaries the vandal conquerors worked in north africa availed them nothing they lost more than they gave
2902-9006-0017 climate bad example and the luxury of power degraded them in one century into a race of helpless and debauched slave holders doomed to utter extermination before the semi gothic armies of belisarius and with them vanished the last chance that the gothic races would exercise on the eastern world the same stern yet wholesome discipline under which the western had been restored to life
2902-9006-0018 that wonderful metaphysic subtlety which in phrases and definitions too often unmeaning to our grosser intellect saw the symbols of the most important spiritual realities and felt that on the distinction between homoousios and homoiousios might hang the solution of the whole problem of humanity was set to battle in alexandria the ancient stronghold of greek philosophy with the effete remains of the very scientific thought to which it owed its extraordinary culture
2902-9006-0019 to synesius's most charming letters as well as to those of isidore the good abbot of pelusium i beg leave to refer those readers who wish for further information about the private life of the fifth century
2902-9006-0020 i cannot hope that these pages will be altogether free from anachronisms and errors
7850-111771-0000 through the influence of hon thomas l hamer he was admitted at west point in eighteen thirty nine
7850-111771-0001 at this time grant was not taken with war and probably evinced little interest in army tactics
7850-111771-0002 grant acted as mustering officer until being commissioned colonel of the twenty first illinois volunteers he took the field
7850-111771-0003 general halleck in speaking of this battle said
7850-111771-0004 indeed if ever a general deserved honor grant had won it he had opened the mississippi to navigation and had captured nearly one hundred thousand prisoners and arms
7850-111771-0005 he was now commander of all the federal forces
7850-111771-0006 the capture of lee was a far more difficult undertaking
7850-111771-0007 time wore away and on the ninth of april eighteen sixty five grant captured the confederate army under lee thus virtually ending the war
7850-111771-0008 when his public services were finished he started in company with his wife son jesse and a few friends
7850-111771-0009 his success seems to have been the outgrowth of hard study and ability to perform the most exhaustive labor without fatigue
6319-57405-0000 in those very early times there was a man named deucalion and he was the son of prometheus
6319-57405-0001 after jupiter had bound prometheus on mount caucasus and had sent diseases and cares into the world men became very very wicked
6319-57405-0002 these men he said to his mighty company are nothing but a source of trouble
6319-57405-0003 but men kept on fighting and robbing even while the rain was pouring down and the sea was coming up over the land
6319-57405-0004 no one but deucalion the son of prometheus was ready for such a storm
6319-57405-0005 the day is coming said prometheus when jupiter will send a flood to destroy mankind from the earth
6319-57405-0006 but deucalion and pyrrha were very sad for they knew that they were the only persons who were left alive in all the land
6319-57405-0007 is there anything that you wish he asked
6319-57405-0008 we should like above all things said deucalion to see this land full of people once more for without neighbors and friends the world is a very lonely place indeed
6319-57405-0009 go on down the mountain said mercury and as you go cast the bones of your mother over your shoulders behind you and with these words he leaped into the air and was seen no more
6319-57405-0010 what did he mean asked pyrrha
6319-57405-0011 surely i do not know said deucalion
6319-57405-0012 when at last they reached the plain they found themselves at the head of a noble company of human beings all eager to serve them
6319-64726-0000 when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast the like of which had never before been known
6319-64726-0001 one of the young fairies overhearing her and fancying she might work some mischief to the little baby went and hid herself behind the hangings in the hall so as to be able to have the last word and undo any harm the old fairy might wish to work
6319-64726-0002 the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound
6319-64726-0003 it is true i cannot entirely undo what my elder has done
6319-64726-0004 now fifteen years after the princess was born she was with the king and queen at one of their castles and as she was running about by herself she came to a little chamber at the top of a tower and there sat an honest old woman spinning for she had never heard of the king's edict
6319-64726-0005 she had no sooner taken up the spindle than being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
6319-64726-0006 he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years
6319-64726-0007 one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches lived there but most believed that it was occupied by a great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ate them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
6319-64726-0008 the young prince at these words felt himself on fire
6319-64726-0009 scarcely had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket opened on one side and the other to offer him a path
6319-64726-0010 he entered a large forecourt and stood still with amazement and awe
6319-64726-0011 but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
6319-64726-0012 he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep
6319-64726-0013 he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing
6319-64726-0014 i have waited long for you
6319-64726-0015 they talked for four hours and had not then said half that was in their heads to say
6319-64726-0016 meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been wakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry
6319-64726-0017 the lady in waiting became very impatient and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her
6319-64726-0018 then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendour but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming for that
6319-64726-0019 the violins and haut boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers in the chapel of the castle
6319-64726-0020 he turned to show them the castle but behold
6241-61943-0000 on the second of the month at two in the morning our precious cargo of luggage was taken on board the good ship valkyrie
6241-61943-0001 but in the cause of science men are expected to suffer
6241-61943-0002 well and have we a fair wind
6241-61943-0003 my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared almost to expect a glimpse of the ghost of hamlet
6241-61943-0004 but no ghost or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls
6241-61943-0005 the fact is the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of denmark
6241-61943-0006 no mister hardwigg said the captain no fear of that
6241-61943-0007 at all events we shall get there some day
6241-61943-0008 on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mount myrdals yokul which the weather being clear we made out very readily
6241-61943-0009 the valkyrie kept off the coast steering to the westward
6241-61943-0010 on all sides were to be seen whole schools of whales and sharks
6241-61943-0011 nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land
6241-61943-0012 the fact was that scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical vessel
6241-61943-0013 then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us
6241-61943-0014 he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the governor of the island baron trampe
6241-61943-0015 the professor knew whom he had to deal with
6241-61943-0016 this modest scholar spoke no languages save icelandic and latin
6241-61943-0017 when therefore he addressed himself to me in the language of horace we at once came to understand one another
6241-61943-0018 now harry said my uncle rubbing his hands an goes well the worse difficulty is now over
6241-61943-0019 in the meantime there is not an hour to lose
6241-61943-0020 very likely i may find there some manuscripts from the hand of saknussemm
6241-61943-0021 i shall be glad to consult them
6241-61943-0022 they were now however absent on duty
6241-61943-0023 though not very large it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries
6241-61943-0024 i have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation
6241-61943-0025 thanks to the heat of these residences grass grows on the roof which grass is carefully cut for hay
6241-61943-0026 i saw but few inhabitants during my excursion but i met a crowd on the beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation
6241-61943-0027 the men appeared robust but heavy fair haired like germans but of pensive mien exiles of a higher scale in the ladder of humanity than the eskimos but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the polar circle
3170-137482-0000 with an education which ought to have ensured me an honourable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised
3170-137482-0001 i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society
3170-137482-0002 i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a man's own conscience
3170-137482-0003 besides i was of opinion that a man's profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his wants and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater wants than those of officers in general
3170-137482-0004 our scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger
3170-137482-0005 we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes
3170-137482-0006 we did the same with physicians whom we often sent half dressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health
3170-137482-0007 whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought it great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the churchwardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass
3170-137482-0008 this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits
3170-137482-0009 in every one of the seventy two parishes of the city of venice there is a large public house called magazzino
3170-137482-0010 yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way
3170-137482-0011 the waiter of the magazzino came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due enjoining silence under penalty of death
3170-137482-0012 we took our three prisoners to a large boat
3170-137482-0013 where is my husband
3170-137482-0014 never fear you shall see him again to morrow
3170-137482-0015 my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night thanking us all with perfect good faith
3170-137482-0016 two days afterwards our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of
3170-137482-0017 it went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had an hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour in drinking
3170-137482-0018 there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed
3170-137482-0019 i picked it up and coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him
3170-137482-0020 i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house
3170-137482-0021 i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying
3170-137482-0022 i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught razetta such a forcible lesson i enquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me
3170-137482-0023 taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be bled again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me
3170-137482-0024 thinking i had a right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required
3170-137482-0025 they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence
3170-137482-0026 he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him
3170-137482-0027 the physician who attended him was named terro he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying a mercurial ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection
3170-137482-0028 delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again
3170-137482-0029 he entreated me to tell him the truth
3170-137482-0030 what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances
3170-137482-0031 unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i liked to put
3170-137482-0032 i obeyed implicitly and met your excellency
3170-137482-0033 the three friends were astounded
3170-137482-0034 i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done
3170-137482-0035 he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer
3170-137482-0036 if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer
3170-137482-0037 they all asked me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus
3170-137482-0038 not very long i answered and i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith whatever in that prediction
3170-137482-0039 they believed that through me they possessed the philosopher's stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe
3170-137482-0040 but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kind hearted to think them the work of the devil and it suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit
3170-137482-0041 they were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples
3170-137482-0042 as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits
3170-137482-0043 i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them
3170-137482-0044 besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speculative chattering of empty fools who having nothing else to do are always trying to find out the cause of every moral phenomenon they meet with which their narrow intellect cannot understand
3170-137482-0045 whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life
3170-137482-0046 your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gondola at your orders my own table and ten sequins a month
3170-137482-0047 you need not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your adviser in everything that may happen to you in everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend
3170-137482-0048 i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my father
2902-9008-0000 the place seemed fragrant with all the riches of greek thought and song since the days when ptolemy philadelphus walked there with euclid and theocritus callimachus and lycophron
2902-9008-0001 the room had neither carpet nor fireplace and the only movables in it were a sofa bed a table and an arm chair all of such delicate and graceful forms as may be seen on ancient vases of a far earlier period than that whereof we write
2902-9008-0002 but most probably had any of us entered that room that morning we should not have been able to spare a look either for the furniture or the general effect or the museum gardens or the sparkling mediterranean beyond but we should have agreed that the room was quite rich enough for human eyes for the sake of one treasure which it possessed and beside which nothing was worth a moment's glance
2902-9008-0003 she has lifted her eyes off her manuscript she is looking out with kindling countenance over the gardens of the museum her ripe curling greek lips such as we never see now even among her own wives and sisters open
2902-9008-0004 if they have ceased to guide nations they have not ceased to speak to their own elect
2902-9008-0005 if they have cast off the vulgar herd they have not cast off hypatia
2902-9008-0006 to be welcomed into the celestial ranks of the heroic to rise to the immortal gods to the ineffable powers onward upward ever through ages and through eternities till i find my home at last and vanish in the glory of the nameless and the absolute one
2902-9008-0007 i to believe against the authority of porphyry himself too in evil eyes and magic
2902-9008-0008 what do i care for food
2902-9008-0009 how can he whose sphere lies above the stars stoop every moment to earth
2902-9008-0010 ay she answered half bitterly and would that we could live without food and imitate perfectly the immortal gods
2902-9008-0011 there is fruit with lentils and rice waiting for you in the next room and bread unless you despise it too much
2902-9008-0012 strange that men should be content to grovel and be men when they might rise to the rank of gods
2902-9008-0013 not that such a creature as that disturbs me no created thing i hope can move my equanimity but if i could stoop to hate i should hate her hate her
2902-9008-0014 and her voice took a tone which made it somewhat uncertain whether in spite of all the lofty impassibility which she felt bound to possess she did not hate pelagia with a most human and mundane hatred
2902-9008-0015 his excellency madam the prefect
2902-9008-0016 and why should that disturb me let him enter
652-130737-0000 never drink any hard liquors such as whisky brandy gin or cocktails with oysters or clams as it is liable to upset you for the rest of the evening

652-130737-0013 claret eighteen ninety eight and nineteen o four
8842-302201-0000 thereafter this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four other things touching my condition the which things it seemed to me that i had not yet made manifest
8842-302201-0001 which thing being thus there came a day when certain ladies to whom it was well known they having been with me at divers times in my trouble were met together for the pleasure of gentle company
8842-302201-0002 but when i still spake not one of them who before had been talking with another addressed me by my name saying to what end lovest thou this lady seeing that thou canst not support her presence
8842-302201-0003 and now that it hath pleased her to deny me this love my master of his great goodness hath placed all my beatitude there where my hope will not fail me
8842-302201-0004 then those ladies began to talk closely together and as i have seen snow fall among the rain so was their talk mingled with sighs
8842-302201-0005 and i declare that when i speak thereof love sheds such perfect sweetness over me that if my courage failed not certainly to him my listeners must be all resign'd
8842-302201-0006 whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon spirits of love do issue thence in flame which through their eyes who then may look on them pierce to the heart's deep chamber every one
8842-302201-0007 to her i wend along in whose much strength my weakness is made strong
8842-302201-0008 so to the road thou shalt be reconciled and find the lady and with the lady love
8842-302201-0009 the second begins here an angel the third here dear song i know
8842-302201-0010 the first part is divided into four
8842-302201-0011 in the third i say what it is i purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by faintheartedness
8842-302201-0012 in the fourth repeating to whom i purpose speaking i tell the reason why i speak to them
8842-302201-0013 in the second i tell what is understood of her on earth here my lady is desired
8842-302201-0014 this second part is divided into two for in the first i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her soul relating some of her virtues proceeding from her soul in the second i speak of her as regards the nobleness of her body narrating some of her beauties here love saith concerning her
8842-302201-0015 this second part is divided into two for in the one i speak of the eyes which are the beginning of love in the second i speak of the mouth which is the end of love
3752-4943-0000 he had been a clerk in a banking house and was transported for embezzlement though by some grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained
3752-4943-0001 when the muster bell rang and the gang broke up rufus dawes on his silent way to his separate cell observed a notable change of custom in the disposition of the new convict
3752-4943-0002 i'm not to go in there says the ex bank clerk drawing back in dismay from the cloud of foul faces which lowered upon him
3752-4943-0003 what is he more than anybody else said the wretched man to himself as he hugged his misery close
3752-4943-0004 about dawn the next morning mister north who amongst other vagaries not approved of by his bishop had a habit of prowling about the prison at unofficial hours was attracted by a dispute at the door of the dormitory
3752-4943-0005 a prisoner refractory your reverence said the watchman
3752-4943-0006 wants to come out mister north
3752-4943-0007 kirkland ghastly pale bleeding with his woollen shirt torn and his blue eyes wide open with terror was clinging to the bars
3752-4943-0008 and beat on the bars with white and sweating hands
3752-4943-0009 i order you sir north cried indignant
3752-4943-0010 very sorry your reverence but your reverence knows that i daren't do such a thing
3752-4943-0011 oh you ministers of christ wolves in sheep's clothing you shall be judged for this
3752-4943-0012 let him out cried north again stamping his foot
3752-4943-0013 there's more trouble with you bloody aristocrats than enough lie quiet
3752-4943-0014 you can guess what that unhappy boy has suffered
3752-4943-0015 impertinent young beggar said burgess
3752-4943-0016 do him good curse him
3752-4943-0017 it's hard for such young uns
3752-4943-0018 have you ever been in that that place i was in last night asked kirkland
3752-4943-0019 what does he care care
3752-4943-0020 if you fall we must fall over you and then you're done for
3752-4943-0021 he had hardly uttered the words when the boy flung himself beneath the log
3752-4943-0022 hold on to me miss nancy said the giant i'm big enough to carry double
3752-4943-0023 but kirkland kept steadily on for the river
3752-4943-0024 just as he reached it however the figure of mister north rose from behind a pile of stones
3752-4943-0025 kirkland jumped for the jetty missed his footing and fell into the arms of the chaplain
3752-4943-0026 oh mister north says kirkland why did you stop me
3752-4943-0027 must stop that fifty lashes troke
3752-4943-0028 that last fellow you had ought to have been tied up himself
3752-4943-0029 i won't have my men knocked up with flogging these rascals
3752-4943-0030 very good your honour says troke
3536-8226-0000 in the last communication which he had received from lady milborough she had scolded him in terms that were for her severe because he had not returned to his wife and taken her off with him to naples
3536-8226-0001 and now it had come to pass that his sole remaining ally mister samuel bozzle the ex policeman was becoming weary of his service
3536-8226-0002 at last he sent word to say that he himself would be in england before the end of march and would see that the majesty of the law should be vindicated in his favour
3536-8226-0003 in making this he had expected no success though from the energetic nature of his disposition he had made the attempt with some zeal
3536-8226-0004 missus bozzle was disposed to think that ladies of quality among whom madame t was entitled in her estimation to take rank were seldom better than they ought to be and she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread by watching the lady or the lady's lover
3536-8226-0005 and had the case been brought before the judge ordinary by means of her husband's exertions she would have taken pleasure in reading every word of the evidence even though her husband should have been ever so roughly handled by the lawyers
3536-8226-0006 a distinct promise of a hundred pounds was made to him if he would have the child ready to hand over to trevelyan on trevelyan's arrival in england
3536-8226-0007 of course it ain't said missus bozzle
3536-8226-0008 the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was bozzle's law
3536-8226-0009 he can't suckle em can he
3536-8226-0010 when a married woman has followers and the husband don't go the wrong side of the post too or it ain't proved again him that he do they'll never let her have nothing to do with the children
3536-8226-0011 i'll tell you what it is b exclaimed missus bozzle it's my belief as he ain't quite right up here and missus bozzle touched her forehead
3536-8226-0012 drat em all what is it they wants they don't know what they wants
3536-8226-0013 it's that as makes em i won't say what
3536-8226-0014 but as for this here child b
3536-8226-0015 trevelyan had followed his letter quicker than he had intended when it was written and was now with his prime minister before his prime minister had been able to take any action on the last instruction received
3536-8226-0016 does one mister samuel bozzle live here asked trevelyan
3536-8226-0017 then bozzle came forward and introduced his wife
3536-8226-0018 but trevelyan was of a different opinion and he was disgusted and revolted most unreasonably by the appearance of his minister's domestic arrangements
3536-8226-0019 bozzle had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a well brushed hat and clean shoes
3536-8226-0020 it is very much easier for such men as mister bozzle to carry decency of appearance about with them than to keep it at home
3536-8226-0021 perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said trevelyan
3536-8226-0022 missus bozzle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat
3536-8226-0023 bozzle away from his own home out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best hat in his hand was aware that he commanded respect and he could carry himself accordingly
3536-8226-0024 i do not suppose that anybody will question my right to have the care of my own child said trevelyan
3536-8226-0025 if you would have gone to mister skint sir suggested bozzle
3536-8226-0026 as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gait and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected
3536-8226-0027 and all work had ceased with him
3536-8226-0028 he's up in town sir a minding of his parliamentary duties
3536-8226-0029 i've watched as sharp as watching can go pretty near
3536-8226-0030 but if you ask me my opinion why in course they've been together somewhere
3536-8226-0031 and bozzle as he said this smiled almost aloud
3536-8226-0032 and he did go away leaving bozzle standing in the middle of stony walk
2428-83699-0000 i imagine there were several kinds of old fashioned christmases but it could hardly be worse than a chop in my chambers or horror of horrors at the club or my cousin lucy's notion of what she calls the festive season
2428-83699-0001 festive yes
2428-83699-0002 the reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand it was a little vague
2428-83699-0003 it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
2428-83699-0004 the whole thing was a trifle odd
2428-83699-0005 there was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept
2428-83699-0006 now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name madge i do not know why
2428-83699-0007 i have never known a madge and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
2428-83699-0008 under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was madge and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
2428-83699-0009 i had no illusions
2428-83699-0010 i did not expect a princely entertainment
2428-83699-0011 all night it had been blowing and raining
2428-83699-0012 i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
2428-83699-0013 i even bought something for madge i mean missus wilson
2428-83699-0014 it was a horrible journey
2428-83699-0015 he was impervious to reason
2428-83699-0016 it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made it warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself
2428-83699-0017 when at last i reached crofton my journey's end it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was stationmaster porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do
2428-83699-0018 no one had come to meet me the village was about half a mile and hangar dene the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across ploughed fields my informant did not mention
2428-83699-0019 there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetching
2428-83699-0020 when the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an open spring cart
2428-83699-0021 in it i was deposited with my luggage
2428-83699-0022 i did not know what he meant
2428-83699-0023 i did not ask i was beyond it
2428-83699-0024 i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry
2428-83699-0025 i had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
2428-83699-0026 here we be that might be so
2428-83699-0027 there be the door in front of you you go up three steps if you can find em
2428-83699-0028 there's a knocker if none of em haven't twisted it off
2428-83699-0029 there appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say
2428-83699-0030 no answer though i allowed a more than decent interval
2428-83699-0031 better ring again suggested the driver hard
2428-83699-0032 maybe they're up to some of their games and wants rousing
2428-83699-0033 the bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house
2428-83699-0034 presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pairs it seemed and a light gleamed through the window over the door
2428-83699-0035 a voice inquired who's there
2428-83699-0036 the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter
2428-83699-0037 there was a rush of retreating feet an expostulating voice then darkness again and silence
2428-83699-0038 who lives here are the people mad
2428-83699-0039 i tolled the bell again
2428-83699-0040 after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand
2428-83699-0041 i'm mister christopher from london
2428-83699-0042 we've lost the key of the cellar and there's nothing out except water and i don't think you'd care for that
6345-93302-0000 she herself should have been a poem a lyric in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs
6345-93302-0001 her hands should have been full of bluebells and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
6345-93302-0002 you see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals
6345-93302-0003 she had to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment the literary sense
6345-93302-0004 and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say
6345-93302-0005 she only wished for may and the orchard instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
6345-93302-0006 the setting of the scene seemed to her all important
6345-93302-0007 it was bitterly cold but the embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage
6345-93302-0008 he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanation
6345-93302-0009 but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
6345-93302-0010 the keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket
6345-93302-0011 her hands and feet were aching with cold
6345-93302-0012 she would have shared his sorrow and shown herself half wife half angel from heaven in this dark hour
6345-93302-0013 she said how frightfully cold it is
6345-93302-0014 and yesterday i had a letter from her and she seems to expect to think and i thought i ought to tell you darling
6345-93302-0015 a shock of unbelievable relief tingled through her so that was all what was it compared with her fears
6345-93302-0016 what opinion would he form of the purity of her mind the innocence of her soul if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply
6345-93302-0017 following the tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification these inspired her
6345-93302-0018 i don't wonder you were afraid to tell me she began you don't love me you've never loved me i was an idiot to believe you did
6345-93302-0019 those four true words wounded her more than all the rest
6345-93302-0020 couldn't help it then how can i ever trust you
6345-93302-0021 do you think i'm not sorry now
6345-93302-0022 no it's only painful for both of us
6345-93302-0023 i didn't think a decent man could do such things she was pulling on her gloves go home and gloat over it all
6345-93302-0024 he stood up suddenly do you mean it
6345-93302-0025 are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this
6345-93302-0026 and he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door it was a very good exit
6345-93302-0027 at the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error
6345-93302-0028 he checked the silly impulse
6345-93302-0029 so he enlisted and went to south africa and he never came home covered with medals and glory which was rather his idea to the few simple words of explanation that would have made all straight and repaid her and him for all the past
5694-64025-0000 shiloh
5694-64025-0001 this was the first big battle in which our regiment had ever been engaged
5694-64025-0002 i do not pretend to tell of what command distinguished itself of heroes of blood and wounds of shrieks and groans of brilliant charges of cannon captured et cetera
5694-64025-0003 about daylight on sunday morning chalmers brigade relieved gladden's
5694-64025-0004 as gladden rode by us a courier rode up and told him something
5694-64025-0005 on sunday morning a clear beautiful and still day the order was given for the whole army to advance and to attack immediately
5694-64025-0006 we were supporting an alabama brigade
5694-64025-0007 that's right my brave first tennessee give em hail columbia
5694-64025-0008 the fact was kept from the troops
5694-64025-0009 we had to pass over the ground where troops had been fighting all day
5694-64025-0010 i had heard and read of battlefields seen pictures of battlefields of horses and men of cannon and wagons all jumbled together while the ground was strewn with dead and dying and wounded but i must confess that i never realized the pomp and circumstance of the thing called glorious war until i saw this
5694-64025-0011 i had been feeling mean all the morning as if i had stolen a sheep but when the order to charge was given i got happy
5694-64025-0012 officers could not curb the men to keep in line
5694-64025-0013 on monday the tide was reversed
5694-64025-0014 but as i said before reader a private soldier is but an automaton and knows nothing of what is going on among the generals and i am only giving the chronicles of little things and events that came under my own observation as i saw them then and remember them now
5694-64025-0015 should you desire to find out more about the battle i refer you to history
5694-64025-0016 about the time he pulled trigger a stray ball from some direction struck him in the side and he fell off dead and his horse becoming frightened galloped off dragging him through the confederate lines
5694-64025-0017 on monday morning i too captured me a mule
5694-64025-0018 he was wise in his own conceit
5694-64025-0019 i frequently thought it would be pleasant to split the difference with that mule and i would gladly have done so if i could have gotten one half of his no
5694-64025-0020 mule did not desire to cross while i was trying to persuade him with a big stick a rock in his ear and a twister on his nose
5694-64025-0021 so he got a large two inch rope tied one end around the mule's neck and the other to the caisson and ordered the driver to whip up
5694-64025-0022 the rope however was stronger than the mule's no and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek
5694-64025-0023 on my taking the rope off he shook himself and seemed to say you think that you are mighty smart folks but you are a leetle too smart
777-126732-0000 all idealisation makes life poorer
777-126732-0001 then why indulge in prophetic phantasies
777-126732-0002 at best they can only interpret the mind of the prophet and can have no objective value
777-126732-0003 michaelis the ticket of leave apostle was speaking in an even voice a voice that wheezed as if deadened and oppressed by the layer of fat on his chest
777-126732-0004 and ever since he had never managed to get his weight down as much as an ounce
777-126732-0005 with his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint but more like a bend in a dummy's limb thrown over the back of a chair he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate
777-126732-0006 yes i had the time to think things out a little he added without emphasis
777-126732-0007 when he rose painfully the thrusting forward of a skinny groping hand deformed by gouty swellings suggested the effort of a moribund murderer summoning all his remaining strength for a last stab
777-126732-0008 his enunciation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger
777-126732-0009 the old terrorist turned slowly his head on his skinny neck from side to side
777-126732-0010 and i could never get as many as three such men together
777-126732-0011 the possessors of property had not only to face the awakened proletariat but they had also to fight amongst themselves yes
777-126732-0012 struggle warfare was the condition of private ownership it was fatal
777-126732-0013 ah he did not depend upon emotional excitement to keep up his belief no declamations no anger no visions of blood red flags waving or metaphorical lurid suns of vengeance rising above the horizon of a doomed society not he
777-126732-0014 don't you think that if i had not been the optimist i am i could not have found in fifteen years some means to cut my throat
777-126732-0015 a harsh laugh from comrade ossipon cut the tirade dead short in a sudden faltering of the tongue and a bewildered unsteadiness of the apostle's mildly exalted eyes
777-126732-0016 alexander ossipon got up tall in his threadbare blue serge suit under the low ceiling shook off the stiffness of long immobility and strolled away into the kitchen down two steps to look over stevie's shoulder
777-126732-0017 very characteristic perfectly typical
777-126732-0018 you would call that lad a degenerate would you mumbled mister verloc
777-126732-0019 it was karl yundt who was heard implacable to his last breath
777-126732-0020 lombroso is an ass
777-126732-0021 for him the criminal is the prisoner simple is it not
777-126732-0022 there was an extraordinary force of suggestion in this posturing
777-126732-0023 the famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as much as his little finger against the social edifice
777-126732-0024 the shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison emptied now useless ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish heap of things that had served their time
777-126732-0025 michaelis the ticket of leave apostle smiled vaguely with his glued lips his pasty moon face drooped under the weight of melancholy assent
777-126732-0026 he had been a prisoner himself
777-126732-0027 his own skin had sizzled under the red hot brand he murmured softly
777-126732-0028 you don't understand he began disdainfully but stopped short intimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face turned slowly towards him with a blind stare as if guided only by the sound
777-126732-0029 he gave the discussion up with a slight shrug of the shoulders
777-126732-0030 stevie accustomed to move about disregarded had got up from the kitchen table carrying off his drawing to bed with him
777-126732-0031 the sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers and he remained staring at the old terrorist as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain
777-126732-0032 his scared eyes blazed with indignation it would hurt terribly his mouth dropped open
777-126732-0033 comrade ossipon's face twitched with exasperation
777-126732-0034 i don't say that protested michaelis gently
777-126732-0035 his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time
777-126732-0036 the coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash and michaelis the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary got up impetuously
777-126732-0037 the disdainful pout of comrade ossipon's thick lips accentuated the negro type of his face
777-126732-0038 he paused then added with modest firmness
777-126732-0039 i would call it cannibalistic that's what it is
777-126732-0040 they are nourishing their greed on the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the people nothing else
777-126732-0041 stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible gulp and at once as though it had been swift poison sank limply in a sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door
777-126732-0042 he closed the door behind their backs with restrained violence turned the key shot the bolt
777-126732-0043 he was not satisfied with his friends
777-126732-0044 with the insight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict
777-126732-0045 there are natures too to whose sense of justice the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous odious oppressive worrying humiliating extortionate intolerable those are the fanatics
777-126732-0046 in any case he had not the time
777-126732-0047 loafing was all very well for these fellows who knew not mister vladimir and had women to fall back upon whereas he had a woman to provide for
777-126732-0048 these were but few and for the first time since he opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its value
777-126732-0049 this survey was unfavourable
777-126732-0050 he took the cash box out of the drawer and turning to leave the shop became aware that stevie was still downstairs
777-126732-0051 he looked dubiously at his brother in law but he did not ask him for information
777-126732-0052 mister verloc perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to stevie
777-126732-0053 he stood still in the middle of the parlour and looked into the kitchen in silence
777-126732-0054 he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen
777-126732-0055 stevie prowled round the table like an excited animal in a cage
777-126732-0056 the light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight of her head reposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plaits for the night
777-126732-0057 her bare feet as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at neck and wrists felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husband's face
777-126732-0058 there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police
777-126732-0059 it's like your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plain
777-126732-0060 the comparison occurred to mister verloc because he had sat astride various army horses in his time and had now the sensation of an incipient fall
777-126732-0061 the prospect was as black as the window pane against which he was leaning his forehead
777-126732-0062 yes not at all well
777-126732-0063 down below in the quiet narrow street measured footsteps approached the house then died away unhurried and firm as if the passer by had started to pace out all eternity from gas lamp to gas lamp in a night without end and the drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible in the bedroom
777-126732-0064 that poor boy is in a very excited state to night she murmured after a pause which lasted for three ticks of the clock
777-126732-0065 this dread led him to make the remark that stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed
777-126732-0066 there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen she affirmed none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head
777-126732-0067 mister verloc's anxieties had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was saying
777-126732-0068 that boy hears too much of what is talked about here
777-126732-0069 if i had known they were coming to night i would have seen to it that he went to bed at the same time i did
777-126732-0070 he was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating people's flesh and drinking blood what's the good of talking like that
777-126732-0071 mister verloc was fully responsive now
777-126732-0072 ask karl yundt he growled savagely
777-126732-0073 he isn't fit to hear what's said here he believes it's all true
777-126732-0074 he knows no better he gets into his passions over it
777-126732-0075 he glared at me as if he didn't know who i was when i went downstairs
777-126732-0076 i wish he had never been to school missus verloc began again brusquely
777-126732-0077 he gets a red face poring over them
777-126732-0078 i wouldn't give a halfpenny for the whole lot
777-126732-0079 the other day stevie got hold of one and there was a story in it of a german soldier officer tearing half off the ear of a recruit and nothing was done to him for it the brute
777-126732-0080 he can't stand the notion of any cruelty
777-126732-0081 comfortable dear
5536-43359-0000 he had neither a national army nor an organized church
5536-43359-0001 her attitude and secret meditations must be such as to instill into the receptive soul of the unborn child the love of the great mystery and a sense of brotherhood with all creation
5536-43359-0002 the ordeal is best met alone where no curious or pitying eyes embarrass her where all nature says to her spirit tis love tis love the fulfilling of life
5536-43359-0003 this wild mother has not only the experience of her mother and grandmother and the accepted rules of her people for a guide but she humbly seeks to learn a lesson from ants bees spiders beavers and badgers
5536-43359-0004 in due time the child takes of his own accord the attitude of prayer and speaks reverently of the powers
5536-43359-0005 indeed the distinctive work of both grandparents is that of acquainting the youth with the national traditions and beliefs
5536-43359-0006 the family was not only the social unit but also the unit of government
5536-43359-0007 the remoter degrees of kinship were fully recognized and that not as a matter of form only first cousins were known as brothers and sisters the name of cousin constituted a binding claim and our rigid morality forbade marriage between cousins in any known degree or in other words within the clan
5536-43359-0008 when she fell the whole race fell with her
5536-43359-0009 before this calamity came upon us you could not find anywhere a happier home than that created by the indian woman
5536-43359-0010 his daily devotions were more necessary to him than daily food
5536-43359-0011 whenever in the course of the daily hunt the red hunter comes upon a scene that is strikingly beautiful or sublime a black thundercloud with the rainbow's glowing arch above the mountain a white waterfall in the heart of a green gorge a vast prairie tinged with the blood red of sunset he pauses for an instant in the attitude of worship
5536-43359-0012 when he becomes an old man he loves to make a notable effort to prove his gratitude
5536-43359-0013 he cuts off the choicest morsel of the meat and casts it into the fire the purest and most ethereal element
5536-43359-0014 the hospitality of the wigwam is only limited by the institution of war
5536-43359-0015 our honor is the guarantee for his safety so long as he is within the camp
5536-43359-0016 love between man and woman is founded on the mating instinct and is not free from desire and self seeking
5536-43359-0017 but to have a friend and to be true under any and all trials is the mark of a man
5536-43359-0018 this bond is between man and man is usually formed in early youth and can only be broken by death
5338-24640-0000 chapter thirty three a confidant
5338-24640-0001 mister morton replied that far from making any claim upon his good opinion his only wish and the sole purpose of his visit was to find out the means of deserving it
5338-24640-0002 evil to him that thinks otherwise said mister morton or who holds church government and ceremonies as the exclusive gage of christian faith or moral virtue
5338-24640-0003 mister morton seemed particularly struck with the account of waverley's visit to donald bean lean
5338-24640-0004 when i was a young man like you mister waverley any such hair brained expedition i beg your pardon for the expression would have had inexpressible charms for me
5338-24640-0005 he certainly possesses talents beyond the rude sphere in which he moves and being neither destitute of ambition nor encumbered with scruples he will probably attempt by every means to distinguish himself during the period of these unhappy commotions
5338-24640-0006 mister morton then made a careful memorandum of the various particulars of waverley's interview with donald bean lean and the other circumstances which he had communicated
5338-24640-0007 he had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness and the petrifying accuracy with which he attended to every form of civility while he tortured me by his questions his suspicions and his inferences was as tormenting as the racks of the inquisition
5338-24640-0008 they held conventicles in the open fields and being treated with great violence and cruelty by the scottish government more than once took arms during those reigns
5338-24640-0009 since that time their numbers have gradually diminished but a good many are still to be found in the western counties and several with a better temper than in seventeen o seven have now taken arms for government
1993-147149-0000 how infinite the wealth of love and hope garnered in these same tiny treasure houses and oh
1993-147149-0001 what bankrupts in the world we feel when death like some remorseless creditor seizes on all we fondly thought our own the twins
1993-147149-0002 the ghoul like fever was not to be braved with impunity and baulked of its prey
1993-147149-0003 the board not so formidable as she had imagined had inquired into her case and instead of sending her to stoke claypole her husband's buckinghamshire parish as she had dreaded had agreed to pay her rent
1993-147149-0004 margaret met jem wilson several days after his brothers were seriously ill and heard from him the state of things at his home
1993-147149-0005 she stopped with her hand on the latch of the wilsons door to still her beating heart and listened to the hushed quiet within
1993-147149-0006 she opened the door softly there sat missus wilson in the old rocking chair with one sick death like boy lying on her knee crying without let or pause but softly gently as fearing to disturb the troubled gasping child while behind her old alice let her fast dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin which she was laying out on a board placed on a sort of sofa settee in a corner of the room
1993-147149-0007 over the child which yet breathed the father bent watching anxiously for some ground of hope where hope there was none
1993-147149-0008 is there any chance for the other one think you
1993-147149-0009 but earnest as the father was in watching the yet living he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead and sprang gently up and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him
1993-147149-0010 wishing him said mary in a tone of inquiry
1993-147149-0011 then the mother lifted up her voice and wept
1993-147149-0012 her cries brought her husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers
1993-147149-0013 mary and alice drew near the fire and stood in quiet sorrow for some time
1993-147149-0014 then alice broke the silence by saying
1993-147149-0015 afore christmas time i was as full as full could be of going home for good and all yo han heard how i've wished it this terrible long time
1993-147149-0016 but he stayed long there and at last his sturdy frame shook with his strong agony
1993-147149-0017 oh jem don't give way so i cannot bear to see you
1993-147149-0018 he did not speak as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment when her soft hand's touch thrilled through his frame and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear
1993-147149-0019 don't jem please don't whispered she again believing that his silence was only another form of grief
1993-147149-0020 mary i almost loathe myself when i feel i would not give up this minute when my brothers lie dead and father and mother are in such trouble for all my life that's past and gone and mary as she tried to release her hand you know what makes me feel so blessed
1993-147149-0021 he remained up stairs until after the early dawn showed mary that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and quiet streets to try and get a little sleep before work hour
1993-147149-0022 so leaving kind messages to george and jane wilson and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to jem and deciding that she had better not she stepped out into the bright morning light so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been
1993-147149-0023 her thoughts ran on jem's manner and words not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day but still she wished he had not put it so plainly
1993-147149-0024 i cannot think what possesses me that i must always be wanting to comfort him when he's downcast and that i must go meddling wi him to night when sure enough it was his aunt's place to speak to him
1993-147149-0025 i think i cannot go right for i either check myself till i'm downright cross to him or else i speak just natural and that's too kind and tender by half
1993-147149-0026 but will he thank me for it
1993-147149-0027 there was something of keen practical shrewdness about her which contrasted very bewitchingly with the simple foolish unworldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which miss simmonds young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other yes
1993-147149-0028 the old leaven infused years ago by her aunt esther fermented in her little bosom and perhaps all the more for her father's aversion to the rich and the gentle
1993-147149-0029 it was a comfort to her when scolded by miss simmonds to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage to order her gowns from the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker
1993-147149-0030 but the best of her plans the holiest that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest were those relating to her father her dear father now oppressed with care and always a disheartened gloomy person
8297-275156-0000 what are you doing here he asked
8297-275156-0001 you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine
8297-275156-0002 we have both seen the same newspaper of course and you have been the first to clear the thing up that's it isn't it
8297-275156-0003 not satisfied with gossip in private the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print and wants more of it than any one editor can supply
8297-275156-0004 supposing the report had been true
8297-275156-0005 in the meantime after what missus presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked poor kitty's natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child
8297-275156-0006 he had promised to do his best toward persuading catherine to grant sydney an interview
8297-275156-0007 even the chance of successfully confiding her to bennydeck's protection had lost something of its fair promise since randal's visit to sydenham
8297-275156-0008 be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now
8297-275156-0009 considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even with an intimate friend
8297-275156-0010 what happier future could await her especially if she justified randal's past experience of all that was candid and truthful in her character than to become his friend's wife
8297-275156-0011 shall i say that she may expect an early visit from you when i see her to morrow
8297-275156-0012 he added sydney's address in a postscript and dispatched his letter that evening
8297-275156-0013 but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captain's proposals were still waiting for catherine's reply
5895-34615-0000 but is laughter a synonym of joy
5895-34615-0001 such perfect completeness is not in nature
5895-34615-0002 had gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation why not
5895-34615-0003 according to all appearance industrious manipulators of children had worked upon his face
5895-34615-0004 it seemed evident that a mysterious and probably occult science which was to surgery what alchemy was to chemistry had chiselled his flesh evidently at a very tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation
5895-34615-0005 gwynplaine was a mountebank
5895-34615-0006 he showed himself on the platform
5895-34615-0007 it was gwynplaine's laugh which created the laughter of others yet he did not laugh himself
5895-34615-0008 the outside did not depend on the interior
5895-34615-0009 no one could escape from this rictus
5895-34615-0010 all his emotions whatever they might have been augmented his strange face of joy or to speak more correctly aggravated it
5895-34615-0011 an everlasting laugh
5895-34615-0012 the manichaeans believed the absolute occasionally gives way and that god himself sometimes abdicates for a time so also of the will
5895-34615-0013 the whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript
5895-34615-0014 with this exception gwynplaine's laugh was everlasting
5895-34615-0015 the joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically
5895-34615-0016 besides we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patients to sleep and of suppressing all suffering only then it was called magic while now it is called anaesthesia
5895-34615-0017 besides this face those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a gymnast and an athlete
5895-34615-0018 gwynplaine had yellow hair
5895-34615-0019 his hair having probably been dyed with some corrosive preparation had left it woolly and rough to the touch
5895-34615-0020 its yellow bristles rather a mane than a head of hair covered and concealed a lofty brow evidently made to contain thought
5895-34615-0021 the operation whatever it had been which had deprived his features of harmony and put all their flesh into disorder had had no effect on the bony structure of his head
2086-149214-0000 the narrative it may be is woven of so humble a texture as to require this advantage and at the same time to render it the more difficult of attainment
2086-149214-0001 in good faith however he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind
2086-149214-0002 the author has considered it hardly worth his while therefore relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rod or rather as by sticking a pin through a butterfly thus at once depriving it of life and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude
2086-149214-0003 if permitted by the historical connection which though slight was essential to his plan the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature
2086-149214-0004 he trusts not to be considered as unpardonably offending by laying out a street that infringes upon nobody's private rights and appropriating a lot of land which had no visible owner and building a house of materials long in use for constructing castles in the air
1993-147965-0000 grandfather came down wearing a white shirt and his sunday coat
1993-147965-0001 morning prayers were longer than usual
1993-147965-0002 he gave thanks for our food and comfort and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us
1993-147965-0003 because he talked so little his words had a peculiar force they were not worn dull from constant use
1993-147965-0004 all afternoon he sat in the dining room
1993-147965-0005 at about four o'clock a visitor appeared mister shimerda wearing his rabbit skin cap and collar and new mittens his wife had knitted
1993-147965-0006 he sat still and passive his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking chair his hands relaxed upon the arms
1993-147965-0007 his face had a look of weariness and pleasure like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain
1993-147965-0008 he made the sign of the cross over me put on his cap and went off in the dark
3536-23268-0000 sir edward not wholly discouraged by the denial with which dorriforth had with delicacy acquainted him still hoped for a kind reception and was so often at the house of missus horton that lord frederick's jealousy was excited and the tortures he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection
3536-23268-0001 every time he beheld the object of his passion for he still continued his visits though not so frequently as heretofore he pleaded his cause with such ardour that miss woodley who was sometimes present and ever compassionate could not resist wishing him success
3536-23268-0002 yet did the watchful miss woodley oftentimes hear a sigh escape from her unknown to herself till she was reminded of it and then a sudden blush would instantly overspread her face
3536-23268-0003 night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her when abroad morning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return
3536-23268-0004 i hope miss milner you pass this evening at home
3536-23268-0005 i thought miss milner you gave me your word that you would pass this evening at home
3536-23268-0006 yes indeed and i believe it is right that i should keep my first promise is it not
3536-23268-0007 missus horton rose from her seat moved the decanters and fruit round the table stirred the fire and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered
3536-23268-0008 nor had this good woman's officious labours taken the least from the awkwardness of the silence which as soon as the bustle she had made was over returned in its full force
3536-23268-0009 miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening sir
3536-23268-0010 and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door
3536-23268-0011 her hand fell motionless from that which she held she appeared motionless herself till missus horton beseeching her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received made her tears flow as if her heart was breaking
3536-23268-0012 it was not from any real cause of grief that she wept but there was a magnetic quality in tears which always attracted her's
3536-23268-0013 do you think i would go answered miss milner with an eagerness that for a time suppressed her tears in contradiction to his will
3536-23268-0014 if you think so madam i see nothing that should prevent me now
3536-23268-0015 niece i command you not to stir out of this room this evening
3536-23268-0016 miss woodley obediently sat down and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber of her friend she never marked by one impertinent word or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered
3536-23268-0017 at the usual hour mister dorriforth and his ward were summoned to tea he entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and though he took up a pamphlet affecting to read it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held it in his hand
3536-23268-0018 miss woodley thought it her duty to be mute and now the gingle of a tea spoon was like a deep toned bell all was so quiet
3536-23268-0019 missus horton too in the self approving reflection that she was not in a quarrel or altercation of any kind felt herself at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable
3536-23268-0020 miss woodley did not recollect herself so but was so in reality in her peace and charity were instinctive virtues accident could not increase them
3536-23268-0021 he coughed drank his tea endeavoured to talk but found it difficult sometimes read and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss milner came into the room not dressed for a ball but as she had risen from dinner
3536-23268-0022 dorriforth read on and seemed afraid of looking up lest he should see what he could not have pardoned
3536-23268-0023 after a few minutes pause and some little embarrassment on the part of missus horton at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct she asked miss milner if she would now have any tea
3536-23268-0024 dorriforth then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servant had left the room thus began
3536-23268-0025 it is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome sometimes unmannerly
3536-23268-0026 forgive the duties of my office and believe that no one is half so much concerned if it robs you of any degree of happiness as i myself am
3536-23268-0027 what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behaviour she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly exprest
3536-23268-0028 she was going to reply but found she could not without accompanying her words with tears therefore after the first attempt she desisted
3536-23268-0029 on this he rose from his chair and going to her said once more shew your submission by obeying me a second time to day
3536-23268-0030 keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future as i find how strictly they are complied with
2412-153954-0000 shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village which started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
2412-153954-0001 my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not help eyeing me nor i them
2412-153954-0002 the streets were narrow and unpaved but very fairly clean
2412-153954-0003 the vine grew outside many of the houses and there were some with sign boards on which was painted a bottle and a glass that made me feel much at home
2412-153954-0004 even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shoplets which had taken root and vegetated somehow though as in an air mercantile of the bleakest
2412-153954-0005 each feature was finished eyelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect
2412-153954-0006 their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly
2412-153954-0007 even in middle age they were still comely and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
2412-153954-0008 the men were as handsome as the women beautiful
2412-153954-0009 i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian
2412-153954-0010 the children were infinite in number and exceedingly merry i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
2412-153954-0011 i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
2412-153954-0012 the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
2412-153954-0013 i saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails
2412-153954-0014 in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
2412-153954-0015 suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but well and handsome
2412-153954-0016 in fact one of them was plainly very much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
2412-153954-0017 the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
2412-153954-0018 they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
2412-153954-0019 but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
2412-153954-0020 again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
2412-153954-0021 we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches
2412-153954-0022 the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
2412-153954-0023 this had some effect in calming him
2412-153954-0024 he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner
6345-64257-0000 when she said good night to beenie and went to her chamber over that where the loved parent and friend would fall asleep no more she felt as if she went walking along to her tomb
6345-64257-0001 at the time mary had noted nothing of these things now she saw them all as for the first time in minute detail while slowly she went up the stair and through the narrowed ways and heard the same wind that raved alike about the new grave and the old house into which latter for all the bales banked against the walls it found many a chink of entrance
6345-64257-0002 when she opened the door of it the bright fire which beenie undesired had kindled there startled her the room looked unnatural uncanny because it was cheerful
6345-64257-0003 she stood for a moment on the hearth and in sad dreamy mood listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake
6345-64257-0004 this was her dream as nearly as she could recall it when she came to herself after waking from it with a cry
6345-64257-0005 she was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before a beautiful house with a large garden behind
6345-64257-0006 it was a summer night and the guests were wandering in and out at will and through house and garden amid lovely things of all colors and odors
6345-64257-0007 but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed with something she did not understand
6345-64257-0008 at the end of it she was in a place of tombs
6345-64257-0009 she entered and the servants soft footed and silent were busy carrying away the vessels of hospitality and restoring order as if already they prepared for another company on the morrow no one heeded her
6345-64257-0010 she was lost lost utterly with an eternal loss
6345-64257-0011 she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go nowhere she wanted to go had not a thought to tell her what question to ask if she met a living soul
6345-64257-0012 but living soul there could be none to meet
6345-64257-0013 she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
6345-64257-0014 he came to her side and she gave him no greeting
6345-64257-0015 i know it and there is no waking
6345-64257-0016 the old time was but a thicker dream and this is truer because more shadowy
6345-64257-0017 her only life was that she was lost
6345-64257-0018 shall i pour out my soul into the ear of a mist a fume from my own brain
6345-64257-0019 thus was she borne away captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless
6345-64257-0020 with that came a pang of intense pain
3752-4944-0000 captain frere says that the scenery is delightful
3752-4944-0001 abandoned indeed by god and man almost
3752-4944-0002 in the valley of the shadow of death he is with us
3752-4944-0003 you have not been long in the colony mister meekin
3752-4944-0004 if you please said meekin gravely
3752-4944-0005 pray help yourself to wine
3752-4944-0006 have you many visitors captain burgess very few
3752-4944-0007 i was quartered with him at sarah island
3752-4944-0008 so he's a friend of yours eh
3752-4944-0009 i had the pleasure of meeting him in society
3752-4944-0010 he is just married you know is he said burgess
3752-4944-0011 the devil he is i heard something about it too
3752-4944-0012 yes one oughtn't to leave the colony without seeing it says burgess it's worth seeing
3752-4944-0013 in fact the ringleader john rex gave me his confession and i sent it to the bishop
3752-4944-0014 a great rascal put in north
3752-4944-0015 well now said meekin with asperity i don't agree with you
3752-4944-0016 he seems to me to be truly penitent for his offences a misguided but not a hypocritical man if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything i hope he is said north
3752-4944-0017 there's no fear of him said burgess cheerily if he grows uproarious we'll soon give him a touch of the cat
3752-4944-0018 i suppose severity is necessary returned meekin though to my ears a flogging sounds a little distasteful
3752-4944-0019 i have these attacks at times
3752-4944-0020 the reverend meekin eyed his clerical brother with horror the reverend meekin was not accustomed to clergymen who wore black neckties smoked clay pipes chewed tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers
3752-4944-0021 so they went on to the verandah and looked down upon the lights of the prison and listened to the sea lapping the shore
3752-4944-0022 by and by a short figure smoking a cheroot came up out of the dark and proved to be doctor macklewain who had been prevented from attending the dinner by reason of an accident to a constable at norfolk bay which had claimed his professional attention
3752-4944-0023 dead said doctor macklewain
3752-4944-0024 delighted to see you mister meekin
3752-4944-0025 but macklewain was tired and wanted to get home
3752-4944-0026 our roads lie together doctor
3752-4944-0027 before the two clergymen had got half way down the steep path that led from the commandant's house to the flat on which the cottages of the doctor and chaplain were built macklewain rejoined them
3752-4944-0028 another flogging to morrow said he grumblingly
3752-4944-0029 whom is he going to flog now
3752-4944-0030 you don't mean to say he's going to flog kirkland
3752-4944-0031 perhaps you'll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that returned macklewain drawing up his little body to its least insignificant stature
3752-4944-0032 mister meekin expressed some alarm but doctor macklewain re assured him
3752-4944-0033 we can't do anything without evidence complain
3752-4944-0034 i shall find my portmanteau in my room you said yes yes
3752-4944-0035 he sleeps at the back and north hurried off
3752-4944-0036 an impulsive gentleman said meekin to macklewain as the sound of mister north's footsteps died away in the distance
3752-4944-0037 macklewain shook his head seriously
3752-4944-0038 he has the strangest fits at times
3752-4944-0039 unless it's a cancer in the stomach i don't know what it can be cancer in the stomach
3752-4944-0040 doctor we all have our crosses have we not
3752-4944-0041 how delightful the grass smells
3752-4944-0042 good night sir i hope you will be comfortable
3752-4944-0043 i'll teach my prisoners to attempt suicide
3752-4944-0044 that's macklewain's business
3752-4944-0045 then don't you interfere with me sir
3752-4944-0046 i've given my orders sir
3752-4944-0047 then captain burgess cried north his pale face flushing i tell you the boy's blood will be on your head
3752-4944-0048 i am a minister of god sir and i forbid you to commit this crime
3752-4944-0049 damn your impertinence sir burst out burgess
3752-4944-0050 you're a dismissed officer of the government sir
3752-4944-0051 this of course was mere bravado on the part of the commandant
3752-4944-0052 north knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip
3752-4944-0053 show mister north out he said and go down to the barracks and tell troke that kirkland is to have a hundred lashes to morrow
3752-4944-0054 i'll show you who's master here my good sir
3752-4944-0055 this is murderous
3752-4944-0056 the government may go to and you too roared burgess get out
3752-4944-0057 they shall not flog that boy he said
3752-4944-0058 i'll report this to the government
3752-4944-0059 i wish i hadn't taken that brandy he said fool that i am
3752-4944-0060 oh god give me strength aid me help me
3752-4944-0061 o lord look down upon me
3752-4944-0062 he mixed a teaspoonful of this in a pannikin of water and drank it
3752-4944-0063 it relieved him for a while
3752-4944-0064 it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force
3752-4944-0065 i must have a teaspoonful he said to allay the craving
3752-4944-0066 twice he paused on the way to the sitting room and twice was he driven on by a power stronger than his will
3752-4944-0067 he smelt the nutty aroma of the spirit
3752-4944-0068 that at all times debasing at this particular time it was infamous that a vice unworthy of any man was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of god in vain
3752-4944-0069 in the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard with the bottle at his lips in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible
8842-302203-0000 and at the first it seemed to me that i saw certain faces of women with their hair loosened which called out to me thou shalt surely die after the which other terrible and unknown appearances said unto me thou art dead
8842-302203-0001 and so strong was my phantasy that i wept again in very truth and said with my true voice o excellent soul how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee
8842-302203-0002 whereby other ladies who were about the room becoming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made who indeed was of my very near kindred led her away from where i was and then set themselves to awaken me thinking that i dreamed and saying sleep no longer and be not disquieted
8842-302203-0003 when being aroused i opened mine eyes and knew that it had been a deception
8842-302203-0004 and my hue was such that they look'd at each other and thought of death saying under their breath most tenderly o let us comfort him then unto me what dream was thine that it hath shaken thee so much
8842-302203-0005 and therewithal such a bewilderment possess'd me that i shut mine eyes for peace and in my brain did cease order of thought and every healthful thing
8842-302203-0006 then saw i many broken hinted sights in the uncertain state i stepp'd into
8842-302203-0007 these wildering phantasies then carried me to see my lady dead
8842-302203-0008 the second part begins here i was a thinking the first part divides into two
8842-302203-0009 this lady's right name was joan but because of her comeliness or at least it was so imagined she was called of many primavera spring and went by that name among them
8842-302203-0010 and in his speech he laugh'd and laugh'd again then while it was his pleasure to remain i chanced to look the way he had drawn near and saw the ladies joan and beatrice approach me this the other following one and a second marvel instantly
8842-302203-0011 the second part begins here saying be now the third here then while it was his pleasure
8842-304647-0000 he lives thy loss he dies from every limb mangled by thee lightnings of godhead shine from which thy darkness hath not where to hide
8842-304647-0001 quinci impara a stupirti
8842-304647-0002 in flesh was raimented how he was killed and buried from the dead how he arose to life with victory and reigned in heaven how all of us shall be glorious like him whose hearts to his are wed how they who die for love of reason give hypocrites tyrants sophists all who sell their neighbours ill for holiness to hell how the dead saint condemns the bad who live how all he does becomes a law for men how he at last to judge shall come again
8842-304647-0003 this world's thick vapours whelm your eyes unworthy of that glorious show blind to his splendour bent upon his shame
8842-304647-0004 money is false and light unless it be bought by a man's own worthy qualities and blood is such that its corrupt disease and ignorant pretence are foul to see
8842-304647-0005 il popolo e una bestia
8842-304647-0006 the people is a beast of muddy brain that knows not its own force and therefore stands loaded with wood and stone the powerless hands of a mere child guide it with bit and rein one kick would be enough to break the chain but the beast fears and what the child demands it does nor its own terror understands confused and stupefied by bugbears vain
8842-304647-0007 most wonderful
8842-304647-0008 that penance hath no blame which magdalen found sweet purging our shame self punishment is virtue all men know
8842-304647-0009 organ of rut not reason is the lord who from the body politic doth drain lust for himself instead of toil and pain leaving us lean as crickets on dry sward
8842-304647-0010 well too if he like love would filch our hoard with pleasure to ourselves sluicing our vein and vigour to perpetuate the strain of life by spilth of life within us stored
8842-304647-0011 heaven help that body which a little mind housed in a head lacking ears tongue and eyes and senseless but for smell can tyrannise
8842-304647-0012 due to thee their praise of maiden pure of teeming motherhood
8842-304647-0013 thou like arcturus steadfast in the skies with tardy sense guidest thy kingdom fair bearing alone the load of liberty
7850-73752-0000 ferdinand meditates over his good fortune
7850-73752-0001 in moments of deep feeling alike sudden bursts of prosperity as in darker hours man must be alone
7850-73752-0002 it requires some self communion to prepare ourselves for good fortune as well as to encounter difficulty and danger and disgrace
7850-73752-0003 this violent and triumphant revolution in his prospects and his fortunes was hardly yet completely comprehended by our friend ferdinand armine and when he had left a note for the generous mirabel whose slumbers he would not disturb at this early hour even with good news he strolled along up charles street and to the park in one of those wild and joyous reveries in which we brood over coming bliss and create a thousand glorious consequences
7850-73752-0004 ferdinand felt his freedom as well as his happiness
7850-73752-0005 it was indeed her handwriting
7850-73752-0006 restless with impending joy he sauntered to the bridge and leant over the balustrade gazing on the waters in charmed and charming vacancy
7850-73752-0007 how many incidents how many characters how many feelings flitted over his memory of what sweet and bitter experience did he not chew the cud
7850-73752-0008 four and twenty hours ago and he deemed himself the most miserable and forlorn of human beings and now all the blessings of the world seemed showered at his feet
7850-73752-0009 the most gifted individuals in the land emulated each other in proving which entertained for him the most sincere affection
7850-73752-0010 he could not flatter himself that he indeed merited such singular blessings and yet with all his faults which with him were but the consequences of his fiery youth ferdinand had been faithful to henrietta
7850-73752-0011 his constancy to her was now rewarded
7850-73752-0012 as for his friends the future must prove his gratitude to them
7850-73752-0013 it was indeed dancing on a volcano
7850-73752-0014 and now all had ended so happily
7850-73752-0015 was it not all a dream of his own creation while his eye had been fixed in abstraction on that bright and flowing river
7850-73752-0016 he might be enchanted but that was the talisman
7850-73752-0017 in the present unsettled though hopeful state of affairs ferdinand would not go home
7850-73752-0018 in exactly ten minutes it is in the power of every man to free himself from all the tumult of the world the pangs of love the throbs of ambition the wear and tear of play the recriminating boudoir the conspiring club the rattling hell and find himself in a sublime sylvan solitude superior to the cedars of lebanon and inferior only in extent to the chestnut forests of anatolia
7850-73752-0019 is papa alone enquired miss temple
5895-34622-0000 what true things are told in stories
5895-34622-0001 in gwynplaine evil thoughts never ripened and he had therefore no remorse
5895-34622-0002 what was this nothing
5895-34622-0003 from sixteen eighty to seventeen o four a great change had taken place
5895-34622-0004 the wheels were all of the same size and high as wagon wheels
5895-34622-0005 this green colour had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage which was known in all the fair grounds as the green box
5895-34622-0006 on the roof from a tube painted green like the rest smoke arose
5895-34622-0007 the astonishment with which the villagers regarded this machine was overwhelming
5895-34622-0008 this was the old establishment of ursus its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into a theatre
5895-34622-0009 unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could of thought
5895-34622-0010 the effect of his appearance had been surprising
5895-34622-0011 some believed it to be natural others declared it to be artificial and as conjecture was added to reality everywhere at every cross road on the journey in all the grounds of fairs and fetes the crowd ran after gwynplaine
5895-34622-0012 the curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another
5895-34622-0013 this fortune had allowed ursus who was the administrator of gwynplaine's success to have the chariot of his dreams constructed that is to say a caravan large enough to carry a theatre and to sow science and art in the highways
5895-34622-0014 for these read fibi and vinos that we may conform to english pronunciation
5895-34622-0015 phoebe cooked venus scrubbed the temple
5895-34622-0016 ursus and homo took charge of each other
5895-34622-0017 this hut in a corner at the back to the right of the door served as bedchamber and dressing room to ursus and gwynplaine
5895-34622-0018 the caravan was divided into three compartments partitioned from each other
5895-34622-0019 a loft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes and on opening a trap door lamps appeared producing wonders of light
5895-34622-0020 ursus was the poet of these magical representations he wrote the pieces
5895-34622-0021 then i look perhaps like what i am
5895-34622-0022 this opening looked for all the world like a mouth of hell in the words of the itinerant puritan preachers who turned away from it with horror
5895-34622-0023 ursus was in everything in the piece in the company in the kitchen in the orchestra
2035-147961-0000 peter told his troubles to mister shimerda he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of november had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow
2035-147961-0001 peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with cutter
2035-147961-0002 she asked peter to wait a moment and when she came back from the kitchen she brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us
2035-147961-0003 we lay still and did not talk
2035-147961-0004 the little house on the hillside was so much the color of the night that we could not see it as we came up the draw
2035-147961-0005 they made me think of defeated armies retreating or of ghosts who were trying desperately to get in for shelter and then went moaning on
2035-147961-0006 i could not take my eyes off the man in the bed
2035-147961-0007 the sharp smell of spirits went through the room
2035-147961-0008 it seemed to me that he despised him for being so simple and docile
2035-147961-0009 the sick man raged and shook his fist
2035-147961-0010 he seemed to be cursing people who had wronged him
2035-147961-0011 quickly it was covered with bright red spots i thought i had never seen any blood so bright
2035-147961-0012 he lay patiently fighting for breath like a child with croup
2035-147961-0013 antonia's father uncovered one of his long bony legs and rubbed it rhythmically
2035-147961-0014 from our bench we could see what a hollow case his body was
2035-147961-0015 gradually relief came to all of us
2035-147961-0016 without a word peter got up and lit his lantern
2035-147961-0017 mister shimerda went with him
2035-147961-0018 after the ceremony at the church the party went to a dinner given by the parents of the bride
2035-147961-0019 the first howls were taken up and echoed and with quickening repetitions
2035-147961-0020 a black drove came up over the hill behind the wedding party
2035-147961-0021 something happened to the hindmost sledge the driver lost control he was probably very drunk the horses left the road the sledge was caught in a clump of trees and overturned
2035-147961-0022 the shrieks that followed made everybody sober
2035-147961-0023 the road was clear and white and the groom's three blacks went like the wind
2035-147961-0024 there are only three sledges left he whispered
2035-147961-0025 and the wolves pavel asked enough enough for all of us
2035-147961-0026 they were within a few miles of their village now
2035-147961-0027 yes how many
2035-147961-0028 twenty thirty enough
2035-147961-0029 now his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two
2035-147961-0030 pavel knocked him over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him
2035-147961-0031 peter crouching in the front seat saw nothing
2035-147961-0032 the first thing either of them noticed was a new sound that broke into the clear air louder than they had ever heard it before the bell of the monastery of their own village ringing for early prayers
2035-147961-0033 they were run out of their village
2035-147961-0034 wherever they went the story followed them
2035-147961-0035 they worked in chicago des moines fort wayne but they were always unfortunate
2035-147961-0036 during the auction he went about with his head down and never lifted his eyes
2035-147961-0037 every one said peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her new owner
2035-147961-0038 the loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old mister shimerda
2035-147961-0039 when he was out hunting he used to go into the empty log house and sit there brooding
2035-147961-0040 this cabin was his hermitage until the winter snows penned him in his cave
2803-154328-0000 they were not to leave it again till the tops of the wahiti ranges were lit with the first fires of day
2803-154328-0001 they had one night in which to prepare for death
2803-154328-0002 the meal ended
2803-154328-0003 sleep which keeps all sorrow in abeyance soon weighed down their eyelids they slept in each other's arms overcome by exhaustion and prolonged watching
2803-154328-0004 if it is decreed that we die to morrow let us die bravely like christian men ready to appear without terror before the supreme judge
2803-154328-0005 god who reads our hearts knows that we had a noble end in view
2803-154328-0006 glenarvan's voice firm till now faltered
2803-154328-0007 john you have promised mary what i promised lady helena what is your plan
2803-154328-0008 i believe said john that in the sight of god i have a right to fulfill that promise
2803-154328-0009 my lord whichever of us survives the other will fulfill the wish of lady helena and mary grant
2803-154328-0010 at last the major said my friends keep that to the last moment
2803-154328-0011 the jailer may forget that he is on guard the prisoner never forgets that he is guarded
2803-154328-0012 on that side descent was impossible and had it been possible the bottom was shut in by the enormous rock
2803-154328-0013 listen said he motioning them to stoop
2803-154328-0014 animal or man answered the major i will soon find out
2803-154328-0015 wilson and olbinett joined their companions and all united to dig through the wall john with his dagger the others with stones taken from the ground or with their nails while mulrady stretched along the ground watched the native guard through a crevice of the matting
2803-154328-0016 what could be the object
2803-154328-0017 did they know of the existence of the prisoners or was it some private enterprise that led to the undertaking
2803-154328-0018 their fingers bled but still they worked on after half an hour they had gone three feet deep they perceived by the increased sharpness of the sounds that only a thin layer of earth prevented immediate communication
2803-154328-0019 john mangles inserting the blade of his poniard avoided the knife which now protruded above the soil but seized the hand that wielded it
2803-154328-0020 but softly as the name was breathed mary grant already awakened by the sounds in the hut slipped over toward glenarvan and seizing the hand all stained with earth she covered it with kisses
2803-154328-0021 watch the savages outside said robert
2803-154328-0022 round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope
2803-154328-0023 my child my child murmured lady helena the savages did not kill you
174-50561-0000 forgotten too the name of gillian the lovely captive
174-50561-0001 worse and worse he is even presumed to be the captive's sweetheart who wheedles the flower the ring and the prison key out of the strict virgins for his own purposes and flies with her at last in his shallop across the sea to live with her happily ever after
174-50561-0002 but this is a fallacy
174-50561-0003 the wandering singer approaches them with his lute
174-50561-0004 the emperor's daughter
174-50561-0005 lady lady my rose white lady but will you not hear a roundel lady
174-50561-0006 o if you play us a roundel singer how can that harm the emperor's daughter
174-50561-0007 she would not speak though we danced a week with her thoughts a thousand leagues over the water singer singer wandering singer o my honey sweet singer
174-50561-0008 but if i play you a roundel lady get me a gift from the emperor's daughter her finger ring for my finger bring though she's pledged a thousand leagues over the water lady lady my fair lady o my rose white lady
174-50561-0009 the wandering singer
174-50561-0010 but i did once have the luck to hear and see the lady played in entirety the children had been granted leave to play just one more game before bed time and of course they chose the longest and played it without missing a syllable
174-50561-0011 the ladies in yellow dresses stand again in a ring about the emperor's daughter and are for the last time accosted by the singer with his lute
174-50561-0012 the wandering singer
174-50561-0013 i'll play for you now neath the apple bough and you shall dream on the lawn so shady lady lady my fair lady o my apple gold lady
174-50561-0014 the ladies
174-50561-0015 now you may play a serena singer a dream of night for an apple gold lady for the fruit is now on the apple bough and the moon is up and the lawn is shady singer singer wandering singer o my honey sweet singer
174-50561-0016 once more the singer plays and the ladies dance but one by one they fall asleep to the drowsy music and then the singer steps into the ring and unlocks the tower and kisses the emperor's daughter
174-50561-0017 i don't know what becomes of the ladies
174-50561-0018 bed time children
174-50561-0019 you see the treatment is a trifle fanciful
6345-93306-0000 the last strains of the ill treated ill fated intermezzo had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barrel organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its repertory to the admiration of the housemaid at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two babies next door
6345-93306-0001 the young man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table for now the late summer dusk was falling and that organ please heaven made full the measure of the day's appointed torture
6345-93306-0002 then there was silence then a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
6345-93306-0003 and again he listened with a quiet pleasure
6345-93306-0004 never had any act seemed so impossible
6345-93306-0005 there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house again she hesitated
6345-93306-0006 then she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round the laurel bushes
6345-93306-0007 look here he said this is all nonsense you know you are tired out and there's something wrong what is it
6345-93306-0008 do drink this and then tell me perhaps i can help you
6345-93306-0009 he hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her
6345-93306-0010 he had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him
6345-93306-0011 is it only that you're poor why that's nothing i'm poor too she laughed
6345-93306-0012 her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently
6345-93306-0013 he told me to stay on at the hotel and i did and then one night when i was at the theatre my maid a horrid french thing we got in paris packed up all my trunks and took all my money and paid the bill and went
6345-93306-0014 she said again you are kind
6345-93306-0015 well then i went into lodgings that wicked woman had left me one street suit and to day they turned me out because my money was all gone
6345-93306-0016 let me think he said oh how glad i am that you happened to come this way
6345-93306-0017 i shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house and then i shall give you my latch key and you can let yourself in and stay the night here there is no one in the house
6345-93306-0018 i will catch the night train and bring my mother up to morrow then we will see what can be done
6345-93306-0019 you see papa's so very rich and at home they expect me to to get acquainted with dukes and things and she stopped
6345-93306-0020 it wasn't i who said that said the girl smiling but that's so anyhow and then she sighed
6345-93306-0021 all the same he added irrelevantly you shall have the latch key
6345-93306-0022 you are kind she said for the third time and reached her hand out to him he did not kiss it then only took it in his and felt how small and cold it was then it was taken away
6345-93306-0023 the lady and the guitar certainly passed the night at hill view villa but when his mother very angry and very frightened came up with him at about noon the house looked just as usual and no one was there but the charwoman
6345-93306-0024 the silver is all right thank goodness she said but your banjo girl has taken a pair of your sister's silk stockings and those new shoes of hers with the silver buckles and she's left these
6345-93306-0025 it was plain that his castanet girl his mother and sister took a pleasure in crediting her daily with some fresh and unpleasing instrument could have had neither taste money nor honesty to such a point as this
1673-143396-0000 a laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has countenanced the belief the hope the wish that the ebionites or at least the nazarenes were distinguished only by their obstinate perseverance in the practice of the mosaic rites
1673-143396-0001 their churches have disappeared their books are obliterated their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith and the softness of their infant creed would be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of three hundred years
1673-143396-0002 yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of christ
1673-143396-0003 his progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom and after a painful agony of mind and body he expired on the cross
1673-143396-0004 he lived and died for the service of mankind but the life and death of socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion and justice and although the stoic or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of jesus the tears which he shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity
1673-143396-0005 the son of a virgin generated by the ineffable operation of the holy spirit was a creature without example or resemblance superior in every attribute of mind and body to the children of adam
1673-143396-0006 nor could it seem strange or incredible that the first of these aeons the logos or word of god of the same substance with the father should descend upon earth to deliver the human race from vice and error and to conduct them in the paths of life and immortality
1673-143396-0007 but the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the east
1673-143396-0008 many among the gentile proselytes refused to believe that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously abjured the humanity of christ
1673-143396-0009 he first appeared on the banks of the jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies
1673-143396-0010 but the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the docetes who taught not that christ was a phantom but that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body
1673-143396-0011 a foetus that could increase from an invisible point to its full maturity a child that could attain the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any nourishment from the ordinary sources might continue to exist without repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter
1673-143396-0012 in their eyes jesus of nazareth was a mere mortal the legitimate son of joseph and mary but he was the best and wisest of the human race selected as the worthy instrument to restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme deity
1673-143396-0013 when the messiah was delivered into the hands of the jews the christ an immortal and impassible being forsook his earthly tabernacle flew back to the pleroma or world of spirits and left the solitary jesus to suffer to complain and to expire
1673-143396-0014 but the justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly questionable and the fate of an innocent martyr at first impelled and at length abandoned by his divine companion might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane
1673-143396-0015 their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and modified the double system of cerinthus
1673-143396-0016 the worthy friend of athanasius the worthy antagonist of julian he bravely wrestled with the arians and polytheists and though he affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration his commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the scriptures
1673-143396-0017 yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at his own rashness apollinaris was heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse and explanation
1673-143396-0018 he acquiesced in the old distinction of the greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man that he might reserve the logos for intellectual functions and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life
1673-143396-0019 but instead of a temporary and occasional alliance they established and we still embrace the substantial indissoluble and everlasting union of a perfect god with a perfect man of the second person of the trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh
1673-143396-0020 under the tuition of the abbot serapion he applied himself to ecclesiastical studies with such indefatigable ardor that in the course of one sleepless night he has perused the four gospels the catholic epistles and the epistle to the romans
1462-170145-0000 on the last saturday in april the new york times published an account of the strike complications which were delaying alexander's new jersey bridge and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on west tenth street
1462-170145-0001 over the fireplace there was a large old fashioned gilt mirror
1462-170145-0002 he rose and crossed the room quickly
1462-170145-0003 of course i know bartley she said at last that after this you won't owe me the least consideration but we sail on tuesday
1462-170145-0004 i saw that interview in the paper yesterday telling where you were and i thought i had to see you that's all good night i'm going now
1462-170145-0005 let me take off your coat and your boots they're oozing water
1462-170145-0006 if you'd sent me a note or telephoned me or anything
1462-170145-0007 i told myself that if i were really thinking of you and not of myself a letter would be better than nothing
1462-170145-0008 he paused they never did to me
1462-170145-0009 oh bartley did you write to me
1462-170145-0010 alexander slipped his arm about her
1462-170145-0011 i think i have felt that you were coming
1462-170145-0012 he bent his face over her hair
1462-170145-0013 and i she whispered i felt that you were feeling that
1462-170145-0014 but when i came i thought i had been mistaken
1462-170145-0015 i've been up in canada with my bridge and i arranged not to come to new york until after you had gone
1462-170145-0016 then when your manager added two more weeks i was already committed
1462-170145-0017 i'm going to do what you asked me to do when you were in london
1462-170145-0018 only i'll do it more completely
1462-170145-0019 then you don't know what you're talking about
1462-170145-0020 yes i know very well
1462-170145-0021 alexander flushed angrily
1462-170145-0022 i don't know what i ought to say but i don't believe you'd be happy truly i don't aren't you trying to frighten me
3576-138058-0000 master and man dismounted from their beasts and as soon as they had settled themselves at the foot of the trees sancho who had had a good noontide meal that day let himself without more ado pass the gates of sleep
3576-138058-0001 but don quixote whom his thoughts far more than hunger kept awake could not close an eye and roamed in fancy to and fro through all sorts of places
3576-138058-0002 at one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave of montesinos and saw dulcinea transformed into a country wench skipping and mounting upon her she ass again that the words of the sage merlin were sounding in his ears setting forth the conditions to be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of dulcinea
3576-138058-0003 who is touching me and untrussing me
3576-138058-0004 dulcinea is perishing thou art living on regardless i am dying of hope deferred therefore untruss thyself with a good will for mine it is here in this retired spot to give thee at least two thousand lashes
3576-138058-0005 seeing this sancho got up and grappling with his master he gripped him with all his might in his arms giving him a trip with the heel stretched him on the ground on his back and pressing his right knee on his chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe
3576-138058-0006 how now traitor exclaimed don quixote
3576-138058-0007 dost thou revolt against thy master and natural lord
3576-138058-0008 dost thou rise against him who gives thee his bread
3576-138058-0009 don quixote gave his promise and swore by the life of his thoughts not to touch so much as a hair of his garments and to leave him entirely free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased
3576-138058-0010 sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head and putting up his hands encountered somebody's two feet with shoes and stockings on them
3576-138058-0011 he trembled with fear and made for another tree where the very same thing happened to him and he fell a shouting calling upon don quixote to come and protect him
3576-138058-0012 don quixote did so and asked him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of
3576-138058-0013 sancho replied that all the trees were full of men's feet and legs
3576-138058-0014 don quixote was on foot with his horse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree and in short completely defenceless he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity
3576-138058-0015 he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist
3576-138058-0016 he saw that his squires for so they call those who follow that trade were about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed so the girdle escaped
3576-138058-0017 he saw me he paid court to me i listened to him and unknown to my father i loved him for there is no woman however secluded she may live or close she may be kept who will not have opportunities and to spare for following her headlong impulses
3576-138058-0018 in a word he pledged himself to be mine and i promised to be his without carrying matters any further
3576-138058-0019 give me my horse and arms and wait for me here i will go in quest of this knight and dead or alive i will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty
3576-138058-0020 nobody need have any doubt about that said sancho for my master has a very happy knack of matchmaking it's not many days since he forced another man to marry who in the same way backed out of his promise to another maiden and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters changing the man's proper shape into a lacquey's the said maiden would not be one this minute
3576-138058-0021 they made haste to overtake them which as the party moved slowly they were able to do with ease
3576-138058-0022 the wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes and recognising claudia said i see clearly fair and mistaken lady that it is thou that hast slain me a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings towards thee for never did i mean to nor could i wrong thee in thought or deed
3576-138058-0023 it is not true then said claudia that thou wert going this morning to marry leonora the daughter of the rich balvastro
3576-138058-0024 on perceiving this claudia when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was no more rent the air with her sighs and made the heavens ring with her lamentations she tore her hair and scattered it to the winds she beat her face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart
3576-138058-0025 cruel reckless woman she cried how easily wert thou moved to carry out a thought so wicked
3576-138058-0026 o husband whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne thee from the marriage bed to the grave
3576-138058-0027 the servants wept claudia swooned away again and again and the whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune
3576-138058-0028 claudia told him she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse
3576-138058-0029 claudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her and thanking him for his offers as well as she could took leave of him in tears
3576-138058-0030 sancho said they had but that three kerchiefs that were worth three cities were missing
3576-138058-0031 what are you talking about man
3576-138058-0032 said one of the bystanders i have got them and they are not worth three reals
3576-138058-0033 at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief came up and said senor there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona
3576-138058-0034 what led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance which is strong enough to disturb the quietest hearts
3576-138058-0035 and if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation come with me and i will show you how to become a knight errant a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice
3576-138058-0036 and now the squires despatched to make the prize came up bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on them and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them
3576-138058-0037 the captains showed plainly the concern they felt the regent's lady was downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated
3576-138058-0038 the regent's lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns that had been assessed as her share at once for the captains had already paid down their sixty
3576-138058-0039 one of the squires observed in his mixture of gascon and catalan this captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman if he wants to be so generous another time let it be with his own property and not ours
3576-138058-0040 they were all taken aback and not one of them dared to utter a word such deference did they pay him
8842-302196-0000 he translated at an early age chiefly between eighteen forty five and eighteen forty nine a great number of poems by the italians contemporary with dante or preceding him and among other things he made a version of the whole vita nuova prose and verse
8842-302196-0001 this book in its original form was received with favour and settled the claim of rossetti to rank as a poetic translator or indeed as a poet in his own right
8842-302196-0002 the life blood of rhythmical translation is this commandment that a good poem shall not be turned into a bad one
8842-302196-0003 the only true motive for putting poetry into a fresh language must be to endow a fresh nation as far as possible with one more possession of beauty
8842-302196-0004 poetry not being an exact science literality of rendering is altogether secondary to this chief law
8842-302196-0005 often would he avail himself of any special grace of his own idiom and epoch if only his will belonged to him often would some cadence serve him but for his author's structure some structure but for his author's cadence often the beautiful turn of a stanza must be weakened to adopt some rhyme which will tally and he sees the poet revelling in abundance of language where himself is scantily supplied
8842-302196-0006 and if you have time it would be a great service to translate the analyses of the poems which i omitted
8842-302196-0007 on january twenty fifth he wrote many and many thanks for a most essential service most thoroughly performed
8842-302196-0008 my notes which you have taken the trouble of revising are of course quite paltry and useless
8842-302196-0009 it is therefore and on all accounts unnecessary to say much more of the work here than it says for itself
8842-302196-0010 throughout the vita nuova there is a strain like the first falling murmur which reaches the ear in some remote meadow and prepares us to look upon the sea
8842-302196-0011 a word should be said here of the title of dante's autobiography
8842-302196-0012 this has induced some editors of the vita nuova to explain the title as meaning early life
7850-286674-0000 a person would think that after a family had lived so long in a place all the neighbors would be fond of them yet it is not so
7850-286674-0001 it is disgraceful
7850-286674-0002 they thought the trouble came from bad bringing up or no bringing up at all
7850-286674-0003 they always ate plain food and plenty of it and they never ate between meals
7850-286674-0004 you would think that with six legs apiece and three joints in each leg they might walk quite fast yet they never did
7850-286674-0005 they did not breathe it into their mouths or through gills but took it in through some openings in the back part of their bodies
7850-286674-0006 both lips asked the larvae
7850-286674-0007 well our lower lips anyway answered the nymph
7850-286674-0008 our upper lips are so small they don't matter
7850-286674-0009 they knew that whenever they stuck out their lower lips at the small fishes and bugs they swam away as fast as they could
7850-286674-0010 indeed the lower lip of a dragon fly child might well frighten people for it is fastened on a long jointed arm like thing and has pincers on it with which it catches and holds its food
7850-286674-0011 but sometimes he straightens the joint and holds his lip out before him and then its pincers catch hold of things he does this when he is hungry
7850-286674-0012 scared dah who's afraid answered he
7850-286674-0013 here comes the snapping turtle
7850-286674-0014 sure enough there he came through the shallow water his wet back shell partly out of it and shining in the sunlight
7850-286674-0015 they thought he might be going to take a nap after his dinner
7850-286674-0016 he began to draw in his legs very very slowly and just as his great hard lower shell touched the mud the last larva crawled out under his tail
7850-286674-0017 the nymphs had already gotten away
1993-147964-0000 they sat about the house most of the day as if it were sunday greasing their boots mending their suspenders plaiting whiplashes
1993-147964-0001 anyway he would never allow one of his horses to be put to such a strain
1993-147964-0002 i had wanted to get some picture books for yulka and antonia even yulka was able to read a little now
1993-147964-0003 she cut squares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a book
1993-147964-0004 on the white pages i grouped sunday school cards and advertising cards which i had brought from my old country
1993-147964-0005 when he mounted his horse at the door i saw that he had a hatchet slung to his belt and he gave grandmother a meaning look which told me he was planning a surprise for me
1993-147964-0006 i put on my cap and ran out to meet jake
1993-147964-0007 he used to help my father cut christmas trees for me in virginia and he had not forgotten how much i liked them
1993-147964-0008 by the time we had placed the cold fresh smelling little tree in a corner of the sitting room it was already christmas eve
1993-147964-0009 from under the lining he now produced a collection of brilliantly colored paper figures several inches high and stiff enough to stand alone
1993-147964-0010 i can see them now exactly as they looked working about the table in the lamplight jake with his heavy features so rudely moulded that his face seemed somehow unfinished otto with his half ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted mustache
7976-105575-0000 grant was only a few miles away but although commander in chief he knew nothing of the hardest fought battle of the civil war until it was over
7976-105575-0001 my own regiment was in the advance
7976-105575-0002 our brigade was fearfully outnumbered
7976-105575-0003 there were no breastworks yet that one little brigade of hamilton's division stood there in the open and repulsed assault after assault
7976-105575-0004 not balaklava nor the alma saw such fighting it was a duel to the death
7976-105575-0005 no battery in the whole four years war lost so many men in so short a time
7976-105575-0006 one daring rebel was shot down and bayoneted clear behind the line of company b where he had broken through to seize the flag of my regiment
7976-105575-0007 that night the enemy slipped away leaving hundreds and hundreds of his dead and wounded on the field
7976-105575-0008 with a few lanterns our men then went about and tried to gather up the wounded the dead were left till morning
7976-105575-0009 it was not a question who was dead or wounded but who was not
7976-105575-0010 fifteen officers of our little half regiment were dead or wounded
7976-105575-0011 i remained awake all night talking with a comrade who shared my blanket with me poor jimmy king
7976-105575-0012 he survived the war only to be murdered later on a plantation in mississippi
7976-105575-0013 when morning came the firing opened and for all that day the battle raged fiercely at the left and center left we getting the worst of it too
7976-105575-0014 that evening an order came for us hamilton's division to assault the enemy's left flank at midnight
7976-105575-0015 under the same quiet moonlight and only six hundred yards away from us also lay the victorious rebel army
7976-105575-0016 once in the night i slipped away from the bivouac and hurried to the old tishimingo hotel to see a lieutenant of my company who had been shot through the breast
7976-105575-0017 i could not help my friend
7976-105575-0018 go back to the regiment he said smiling all will be needed
7976-105575-0019 my friend with many others was being carried out to die elsewhere
7976-105575-0020 i hastened back to the lines
7976-105575-0021 the cloud of rebels we had seen divided itself into three columns
7976-105575-0022 a perfect blaze of close range musketry too mowed them down like grass
7976-105575-0023 they lay in heaps of dozens even close up to the works
7976-105575-0024 that night i stood guard under an oak tree on the battlefield among the unburied dead
7976-105575-0025 indeed we of the rank and file had little confidence in grant in those days
7976-105575-0026 rosecrans protested it was in vain
7976-105575-0027 it required months and great events to make grant the hero of the army which he afterward became
7976-105575-0028 for some reason the dead at hatchie bridge were not buried
7976-105575-0029 a week after the battle my brother rode by there on a cavalry expedition and made the horrible discovery that hogs were eating up the bodies of our dead heroes that too was war
1462-170142-0000 the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable
1462-170142-0001 emerging at euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon alexander had his luggage sent to the savoy and drove at once to bedford square
1462-170142-0002 she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
1462-170142-0003 the room was empty when he entered
1462-170142-0004 a coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit for it was already beginning to grow dark outside
1462-170142-0005 she called his name on the threshold but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it
1462-170142-0006 she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder
1462-170142-0007 i never dreamed it would be you bartley
1462-170142-0008 when did you come bartley and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
1462-170142-0009 she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
1462-170142-0010 i'll do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously
1462-170142-0011 he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
1462-170142-0012 hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes
1462-170142-0013 it it hasn't always made you miserable has it
1462-170142-0014 always but it's worse now
1462-170142-0015 it's unbearable it tortures me every minute
1462-170142-0016 i am not a man who can live two lives he went on feverishly each life spoils the other
1462-170142-0017 i get nothing but misery out of either
1462-170142-0018 there is this deception between me and everything
1462-170142-0019 at that word deception spoken with such self contempt the color flashed back into hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash
1462-170142-0020 she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly in front of her
1462-170142-0021 could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly bartley as if i were a friend and not some one who had to be defied
1462-170142-0022 he dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire
1462-170142-0023 i have thought about it until i am worn out
1462-170142-0024 after the very first
1462-170142-0025 hilda's face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
1462-170142-0026 she pressed his hand gently in gratitude weren't you happy then at all
1462-170142-0027 something of their troubling sweetness came back to alexander too
1462-170142-0028 presently it stole back to his coat sleeve
1462-170142-0029 yes hilda i know that he said simply
1462-170142-0030 i understand bartley i was wrong
1462-170142-0031 she listened intently but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair
1462-170142-0032 you want me to say it she whispered
1462-170142-0033 bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth
1462-170142-0034 it's got to be a clean break hilda
1462-170142-0035 oh bartley what am i to do
1462-170142-0036 you ask me to stay away from you because you want me
1462-170142-0037 i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
1462-170142-0038 hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders
1462-170142-0039 you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
1462-170142-0040 and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
1462-170142-0041 she slid to the floor beside him as if she were too tired to sit up any longer
1462-170142-0042 don't cry don't cry he whispered
5536-43358-0000 the savage philosopher the dual mind
5536-43358-0001 the original attitude of the american indian toward the eternal the great mystery that surrounds and embraces us was as simple as it was exalted
5536-43358-0002 it was silent because all speech is of necessity feeble and imperfect therefore the souls of my ancestors ascended to god in wordless adoration
5536-43358-0003 none might exhort or confess or in any way meddle with the religious experience of another
5536-43358-0004 among us all men were created sons of god and stood erect as conscious of their divinity
5536-43358-0005 that solitary communion with the unseen which was the highest expression of our religious life is partly described in the word bambeday literally mysterious feeling which has been variously translated fasting and dreaming
5536-43358-0006 the first bambeday or religious retreat marked an epoch in the life of the youth which may be compared to that of confirmation or conversion in christian experience
5536-43358-0007 knowing that god sets no value upon material things he took with him no offerings or sacrifices other than symbolic objects such as paints and tobacco
5536-43358-0008 at the solemn hour of sunrise or sunset he took up his position overlooking the glories of earth and facing the great mystery and there he remained naked erect silent and motionless exposed to the elements and forces of his arming for a night and a day to two days and nights but rarely longer
5536-43358-0009 when he returned to the camp he must remain at a distance until he had again entered the vapor bath and prepared himself for intercourse with his fellows
5536-43358-0010 it was not then wholly from ignorance or improvidence that he failed to establish permanent towns and to develop a material civilization
5536-43358-0011 to the untutored sage the concentration of population was the prolific mother of all evils moral no less than physical
5536-43358-0012 in this type of prayer there was no beseeching of favor or help
5536-43358-0013 from the sun as the universal father proceeds the quickening principle in nature and in the patient and fruitful womb of our mother the earth are hidden embryos of plants and men
5536-43358-0014 this is the material or physical prayer
5536-43358-0015 nothing of the marvelous could astonish him as that a beast should speak or the sun stand still
5536-43358-0016 who may condemn his superstition
5536-43358-0017 here is the supreme mystery that is the essence of worship without which there can be no religion and in the presence of this mystery our attitude cannot be very unlike that of the natural philosopher who beholds with awe the divine in all creation
5536-43358-0018 in his own thought he rose superior to them he scorned them even as a lofty spirit absorbed in its stern task rejects the soft beds the luxurious food the pleasure worshiping dalliance of a rich neighbor
5536-43358-0019 the historians of the white race admit that the indian was never the first to repudiate his oath
